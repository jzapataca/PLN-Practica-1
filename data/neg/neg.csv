El juego es exelente. me encantan todos los Life is Strange, este juego está a la altura de los demás, no me gusto que se hable poco de chloe y la dejen de lado asi sin mas, los nuevos personajes están bien y la historia es exelente arrancando lento pero muy atrapante, el unico pero seria que en 4K hay algunas partes medio mal optimizadas, pero en general anda muy bien de rendimiento."

Life is Strange Double Exposure - Preview

Mi experiencia con estos dos primeros episodios fue estupenda. Me mantuvo atrapado en las paredes de Caledon arañando el velo de la realidad para saltar entre portales a otro mundo. Uno más cálido. Uno donde la vida no es tan dura. Uno donde aun es posible salvar el día. Fue extraño volver a controlar a Max, pero al mismo tiempo, se siente como si nada hubiese cambiado. Es tan adorable e inocente como el ultimo día que la vimos en Arcadia Bay. Ahora un poco más adulta, pero dentro permanecen presentes todas las cicatrices de su pasado. Double Exposure trae consigo otro relato criminal con el que sentirnos como Nancy Drew en una de sus novelas, pero… con nuevos poderes. La idea de caminar entre dos realidades en simultaneo, tal cual Prince of Persia, tiene su encanto. La perpetuidad de sus decisiones y el impacto que generan en el entorno como en los propios personajes se percibe desde el primer minuto. Realmente me dejo con ganas de más. Termina justo cuando las cosas se calientan.

Sin lugar a dudas, los fanáticos de la serie pueden respirar tranquilos, Deck Nine ha logrado traer a Max en su mejor estado con una historia llena de suspenso y misterio que nos mantendrá pegados a la pantalla de principio a fin. ¿Única contra? Esperar por el resto de episodios."

Años esperando a que regresara Max Caulfield y finalmente el momento ha llegado, y puedo decir que la espera ha valido totalmente la pena. El juego va excelente en optimización, y el nivel narrativo es estupendo, al igual que la mejora gráfica y la banda sonora, pero era de esperarse de un Life Is Strange, simplemente un juegazo. Me encanta 10/10."

No seré muy objetiva por que realmente me considero una fanática de los anteriores juegos, pero llevo un capitulo jugado y aun me mantiene expectante, aunque la primera hora ha sido un poco aburrida, aun le tengo fe. RECOMENDADO.

COMO QUE TENGO QUE PAGAR MAS PARA VER AL GATO CUL1AO EN EL CAPITULO 2!!!!!!!!"

RESEÑA LIBRE DE SPOILERS (afortunadamente)

Antes de iniciar: Si, terminé los 5 eps.

He sido fan de Life is Strange desde que salió el primer juego y me encantó absolutamente, sugiero que , el cariño con los personajes de esos previos juegos es casi un pilar en éste para comprenderlo de mejor manera tanto el entorno y algunas formas de tomar decisiones por parte de Max.

Simplemente me encantó la escencia de la Max como adulta (tal vez porque estoy en una etapa muy similar) y cómo ésta lidia con su pasado y presente, es otro enfoque que, la verdad, encuentro un avance significativo con respecto al enfoque que le dieron a Alex en LIS True Colors.
Deck Nine hizo un trabajo estupendo con el juego (me sentí como mi yo de 12 - 13 años).

Pd: Hay bugs de todas formas pero son mínimos."

This is a 'get it, but wait for a sale' game. I mean a HUGE sale. This game is insanely expensive for what you get, even at the base price. And I've been a big Max fan since the very beginning.

I feel for those who paid 80 dollars for the Ultimate Edition when you can finish this entire game in a day. Shaq would call that 'robberation' . There isn't much re-play value, so I can't even go with that excuse.

If you read enough reviews you will see a pattern. It is easy to assume that these are die hards and they wouldn't be happy with anything because 'wah wah wah, Max and Chloe' but that's not true. We all wanted to really really enjoy this game. Many aspects felt very AAA - very well thought out, great execution -truly captivating. Some of the writing and voice acting is the best of the best. But then that moment would be ruined with a straight up dumb action or line that felt weirdly improvised or extremely rushed. The longer it went on the more I realized I had no idea what any character would say or think next whatsoever given any situation, including Max. That makes you feel less involved....you are just there for the ride.

The ending? Well, I feel like a certain part was tacked on at the end after some internal discussions: 'maybe this ending does feel rushed, we have to respond to that' and that was a bit off putting and outright ODD. The second half is so rushed with many things so poorly explained I became quite confused on what I was even deciding to do (not that choices seemed to matter much).

Kinda wish they re-wrote most of the story, starting with the middle of Episode 3. I'm not just talking about the main mystery, but certain inconsistencies with characters, not feeling connected to any of the characters - or even liking most of them. It's missing a lot of character development that you saw even with the minor characters in the first LiS.

The whole thing seems to go from 0 to 100 then fades to black - all the while missing the heart, soul, and charm we came for."

El juego es asombroso. He sido fan de todos los Life is Strange y variantes como Twin Mirror y Tell Me Why.
Este juego está a la altura de los Life is Strange anteriores sin duda alguna. Obvio ya no sale Chloe como antes, pero no dejan de lado la historia original del primero, sí la mencionan y explican brevemente qué sucedió. Los nuevos personajes están bien y la historia está muy bunea. La verdad creo que las reseñas negativas son mayoritariamente gente que no está feliz porque ya no sale Chloe y está afferado a lo anterior.
Desde el primer episodio hasta el último esete juego me enganchó y no quería dejar de jugaro."

A Very Mixed Review

I’ve just completed the game, and while I have a lot of thoughts on it, I’ll break them down into clear Pros & Cons without any spoilers at first:

-Pros
1) Incredible Music – Without a doubt, the music in this game is the standout feature for me. It sets the mood perfectly and is probably the aspect I enjoyed most.
2) Stunning Visuals – The graphics are absolutely breathtaking. The attention to detail, vibrant colors, and overall artistic design really elevate the experience.
3) Impressive Facial Expressions – The facial animations are top-tier, capturing subtle emotions that make the characters feel real and immersive.
4) New Power – The new gameplay power is a fresh and intriguing mechanic, offering something unique to the experience.
5) Well-Developed Characters – The new characters are all well fleshed out with interesting backstories. Most of them feel essential to the narrative, with none coming off as unnecessary or flat.
6) Gripping Early Episodes – Episodes 1, 2, and 3 are incredibly engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
7) Length and Replayability – While the average gameplay is around 10-12 hours, I spent about 17.5 hours on my first playthrough, thanks to my tendency to explore every nook and cranny. There’s plenty to find for those who enjoy digging deeper.
8) Voice Acting – The voice acting is stellar, with each character feeling well-represented by their respective voice actors.


1) Underutilized Power – While the new power is cool, I felt it wasn’t explored to its full potential. It could have been expanded with more depth, challenges, or consequences.
2) Lack of Meaningful Choices – One of the biggest draws of the Life is Strange series has always been the tough moral choices that force you to stop and think. Unfortunately, I didn’t feel most of my decisions had much impact in this game. I made most choices within minutes, and they didn’t have the weight I expected.
3) Plot Holes & Unanswered Questions – This game is riddled with unresolved plot points and story holes. By the end, I found myself frustrated by all the loose ends that never got tied up.
4) Overwhelming LGBTQ+ Representation – As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I’m all for representation. However, in this game, it feels excessive. While I appreciate inclusivity, having every character be part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum feels unrealistic. A more balanced approach would have been preferable.
5) DLC Locked Achievements – Some of the achievements require you to purchase DLCs, which feel like a cash grab. The DLCs mainly offer cosmetic items (like extra outfits and a cat), which should have been included in the base game.
6) Price vs. Content – While the game’s graphics and design are impressive, the overall experience doesn’t feel worth the full price tag. I’d recommend waiting for a sale to get better value.
7) Limited Exploration – Despite the stunning graphics, there’s a noticeable lack of locations to explore. The world feels smaller than I would have liked, especially given the effort put into the design.

















Visuals: 8.5/10
Sound: 8.5/10
Gameplay: 5/10
Characters: 7/10
Storytelling: 5/10

Overall, I’d give this game a 6/10. Despite the impressive music, visuals, and voice acting, the lack of meaningful choices and the abundance of plot holes really held it back. As much as I wanted to love it, the story just didn’t live up to expectations. I’d recommend this to Life is Strange fans, but don’t expect it to surpass the first game or become your new favorite in the series."

Overall, I enjoyed the game and think most fans of the series will too. However, it does have a good number of flaws (no spoilers):
• This was clearly made with a limited budget which explains the game’s shortcomings with limited choices, small cast, and small scenes/maps.
• The skeleton of the story is good. I liked the story and how it can lead to other entries in the series. However, the meat (specific actions and dialog) of the story is weak.
• Choices don’t really have any material impact on the story and instead mainly lead to some different dialog options instead of completely different scenes with the romance options leading to the most variation.
• There’s no defining choice(s) likes in the first game which leads back to the limited budget. They don’t appear to have the funds to make branching storylines which explains how they handled the ramifications of Chole/Arcadia Bay decision in this installment.
• Some scenes were handled poorly and don’t take into account some of your earlier dialog/choices. For example, you’ll learn an important piece of information and in a later scene when it comes up, Max acts completely surprised like it’s the first time she’s heard it. Or you’ll see a character step outside and eavesdrop on their conversation, walk a few feet and talk to another character who asks you where said person is and Max replies she doesn’t know. Like you can literally see that character outside the window. Come on, that’s just lazy.
• It was lacking in the personal moments like the first game and True Colors. Double Exposure’s version of True Colors’ Halloween was a big step down.
• The maps/levels are limited and very small (well, smaller than the previous games) with only a handful of NPCs and characters you can speak too. They seem smaller and less lively than the first game and True Colors. It reminds me of Starfield’s nightclub with a few NPCs standing around and even fewer dancing versus Cyberpunk 2077’s packed and lively clubs. It just feels so antiquated in 2024. Again, this likely stems from a limited budget.
• Due in part to the small map sizes, the puzzles/gameplay is way too easy and doesn’t have the variation of the branching outcomes like the first game.
• Audio is borked. The background music is too loud drowning out dialog, but at least you can easily lower that in the settings. The big problem is dialog audio which is often way too quiet even at max settings and cranking my headphones to full volume. In addition, when having a conversation Max would speak clearly at a certain level and often the other speaker(s) dialog would come in far too low in volume and with poorer sound quality.
• The soundtrack is a big step down from the first game. It’s not bad, it’s just completely forgettable.
• There are some points where if you walk to a certain place, it moves you to the next scene without warning and you’ll be unable to go back to complete anything you missed in the previous area unless you reload the last checkpoint.
• No cutscene skipping which is really annoying if you want to replay the game or reload the last checkpoint if you missed something due to the above.
• The final episode was the weakest. It seems like True Color where they clearly ran out of time and/or money and needed to wrap things up. However, it was a good setup for the next game and I like the direction the sequel appears to be going in.
Despite its flaws, I did enjoy my time with the game, and I recommend it."

Traía dudas acerca de los comentarios que habían durante el acceso anticipado, pero honestamente la historia se pone muy buena, tiene esos giros de trama que no te esperas ver y sobre todo está más que genial que tenga tanto referencias como explicación de la historia del primer juego, excelente juego y la historia me tiene totalmente atrapado y sobre todo estoy fascinado con la increíble capacidad del motor gráfico para mostrar las emociones de los personajes 1000/10"

muy buen juego aunque no es el mejor de la saga y yo jugue todos menos el true colors que con solo probar la demo no me gusta, el final es un asco sinceramente y el unico capitulo que me gusto fue el 5 y tal vez el 3 o 2,de los personajes me gustaron 3 incluyendo la prota, y eso que hay como 10 personajes, sinceramente lo recomiendo pero no por esa plata, es preferible comprarse el 1 o 2 que son mejores y te salen mas baratos, este lis no es el mejor de la saga pero no es el peor"

Hoy lo termine y es hermoso. Es una historia que te envuelve, me trajo recuerdos de cuando jugue al 1, del nerviosismo de que va a pasar, y por unos momentos me sentía igual que Max. Sin dejar esa nostalgia que hizo que disfrutará mucho más de esta historia. Es un juego que recomiendo si probaste los anteriores, la optimizacion no es la mejor pero lo compensa con esa calidad gráfica que es insuperable y una historia que supera a todas las anteriores entregas. A mi parecer es 10 de 10"

Ya me considero fan de la saga peeeero este LIS le falta pulir varias cosas como los bugs, errores graficos y un poco la historia. SOLO DIRE que lanzaron al caño mucho de la historia aqui y como dicen todos ""MAXX CARREA ESTE JUEGO"" Y es verdad pero esperemos que sucede en el DLC o en su proximo juego no lo sabremos hasta dentro de 3 a 4 años
Ahora que puedo comentar de verdad hay muchas cosas que flaquea el juego y de verdad hace falta que donot se encargue de la franquicia. tuvieron mucho que explotar en este juego como el hecho de las dimensiones, la nueva max y esas cosas o ya que max esta tan rota en cuanto a poderes cambiarle la historia a muchos de los protagonistas de los otros juegos (como cameo pudiera haber sido hermoso)"

Ok, Sere muy honesto, Estuvo muy bien la historia y el gameplay PERO si hubieron unos cuantos bugs, Fallos en texturas, fallos en los modelos, etc. Pero si le doy entre un 1 al 10 le doy un 8 por lo ya mencionado, también esperaba que el final seria mas como el primer life is strange pero fue mas como una decision que no se sintio como un final si no mas bien como si hubiera otro capitulo pero no fue asi."

Life is Strange: Double Exposure ofrece una narrativa emocionante. El episodio 1 puede parecer algo lento, pero créanme que el episodio 2 les va a volar la cabeza.

La atmósfera visual y la banda sonora son excepcionales, creando una experiencia inmersiva y conmovedora. Esta es una versión de acceso anticipado y puede presentar pequeños bugs, que no afectan de manera significativa la experiencia del juego."

El juego es muy bueno, lo que se podría esperar de un ""Life is Strange"", como alguien que sigue la saga desde hace tiempo (Tanto que tuvo que re-comprar los juegos en steam porque lo jugaba en consolas jaja) puedo decir que es bueno, la historia, la música, el investigar el mundo, tomar tu tiempo paseando es tan satisfactorio y relajante como debe de ser con las entregas de esta saga, como se puede ver, me pase un aprox de 15 hrs para pasarme el juego, eso habla de lo mucho que me tuvo inmerso, aunque también habla de lo lento que puedo llegar a ser jaja.

Este juego también tiene puntos negativos (No relacionados a la historia) que me gustaría destacar por si alguien aun lo ha comprado y esta decidiendo aun:

1. Mala Optimización: Le cuesta correr decentemente aun teniendo la configuración en medio, requiere de parches para arreglar eso.

2. Audio: Algunas pistas de audio pueden llegar a cortarse o sobreponerse unas sobre otras en las mismas cinemáticas, no hablo del gameplay, o el volumen de estas también puede ser muy alto o aveces inexistente.

3. Ultimate Version: Si buscas algo grande por la versión ultimate, específicamente hablando del contenido de gatos, no esperes mucho, no es historia aparte, solo incluye diálogos extra y como dice el nombre, gatos, si eres una persona que es mala financiera mente o no le importa gastar, adelante, aunque no vale la pena pagar extra únicamente por 3 skins y unos diálogos extra.

Resumen: El juego si es extraordinario, y es la formula de un ""Life is Strange"", sin embargo, si buscas comprarlo, recomiendo esperar un poco hasta que lancen parches o algo por el estilo para arreglar problemas de rendimiento, audio, bugs ,etc.

Aquí únicamente hable de cosas técnicas para no incluir spoilers, sin embargo esos puntos me parecen importantes y espero alguien los tome en cuenta, amo esta saga y por eso espero que arreglen eso porque es un juego que se debería poder disfrutar sin sufrir errores o que no den ""contenido"" extra que solo sean mas diálogos..."

This game is difficult to recommend, and I would've loved a mixed rating here. I like many aspects of it but also dislike many other things. Let me give you a list of both, and then you can decide if this is something for you.

This game is a sequel to the original Life is Strange game, which I liked a lot. Returning to Max Caulfield felt great; she felt the same, but older. The game really takes your final choice of that game into consideration, but I didn't like what they chose for Max and Chloe if you chose ""her"" in the ending of the first game. The rest would be story spoilers, and I won't talk about any of them, so here's my list of things I liked and disliked.

What I liked was the beginning of the story. I really enjoyed the first three chapters before they went in a direction with chapters 4 and 5 that I felt mixed about. The graphics look beautiful, the facial animations look incredible, and the characters feel alive; they did a good job showing their emotions.

Max still felt like Max, and her voice actor once again did a great job with her. I also appreciated the 'toggle run' option, so you don't constantly have to hold a button to move at a decent speed. I also really enjoyed the teaser at the end if you chose the Chloe ending in the first Life is Strange game.

What I didn't like were quite a few things. It felt like most of the choices didn't matter because they didn't have a huge impact on the story. Most choices also weren't very well balanced because the majority of players picked one option over the other, and I feel a great choice is one where people are really split. The game also had some boring filler moments that seemed to be there just to stretch out game time. But still, the game is kind of short. I also really disliked how few locations there were in the game. I would've loved to see many more; even though you return to some of them, it started to feel repetitive.

Also, in the last chapter, there's a big decision moment where you don't get to make the decision yourself, which felt strange. I also think the game sometimes tries to push a certain agenda on the player, which felt off-putting at times. Last but not least, many plotlines are left unresolved, and the last two chapters felt off and didn't carry the same emotional weight that I expect from the series.

As you can see, I felt really mixed about this experience. This is why I would've loved a mixed option. I appreciate that this game is priced lower (it's €50 instead of €60 like True Colors), but it still felt expensive for what you get. I feel like €30 would be a perfect price for this experience, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale before buying it.

All in all, if I have to choose whether to recommend it or not, I'd say it's worth it when it's on sale and if you're a huge fan of the series. In the end, I had enough fun with this game, and coming back to Max felt great. I can't wait to see where her next journey takes her. Without spoiling anything, I hope it focuses on different characters or returns to Chloe if you chose that option in the first game. It's disappointing that the beginning was solid, but left me mixed by the end. Still, I hope for the best for the series, and I'm curious about the next game."

Es un regreso interesante de Max a la franquicia de Life is Strange, la historia tiene unos giros impresionantes y totalmente inesperados. Sin embargo, esperaba un final que te dejara una sensación similar al primer juego, pero se entiende que no lo haga ya que...

“No puedo dejar que pase de nuevo”

Life is Strange: Double Exposure trae de vuelta a Max Caulfield, esta vez para resolver el misterio de la muerte de su mejor amiga. Deck Nine toma elementos de los cómics, secuela de Life is Strange (2015), y los integra en su historia, logrando un toque familiar para los lectores de los cómics, pero también algo fresco y nuevo.

Análisis del juego

Narrativa
La historia sigue un esquema similar al primer juego, pero se diferencia rápidamente gracias al contexto y los personajes. La narrativa tiene sus altibajos; no siempre logra mantener el mismo nivel de tensión o sorpresa, pero en general, sigue siendo interesante y coherente. Los son simpáticos y es fácil interesarse en ellos, ya sea para bien o para mal. Sin embargo, los se sienten algo superficiales y desaprovechados, aunque muestran potencial para más desarrollo.

Las del juego son las mismas que en entregas anteriores: el uso de los poderes del protagonista y la toma de decisiones. En esta ocasión no podremos usar libremente los de Max, pero seguirán siendo uno de los impulsores principales de la narrativa. El impacto de las en este juego es menos palpable en una única partida, haciendo que este aspecto se sienta mucho menos importante.

El estilo artístico sigue la línea de , pero con mejoras gráficas notables. El motor gráfico da un aspecto más realista a los modelados de los personajes y el entorno, incluyendo la iluminación y las expresiones faciales. Todo esto le da al juego un aspecto más moderno sin perder la esencia artística de la franquicia. Además, el rendimiento del juego es sólido y bien optimizado.

La banda sonora, una selección excepcional de , sigue siendo crucial para la atmósfera del juego, manteniendo el estilo melancólico y emotivo típico de la serie. Los efectos sonoros y el doblaje también están a la altura, logrando una inmersión total.


tomó una decisión audaz al dejar fuera a , lo cual puede desconcertar a algunos fans debido a lo entrelazadas que siempre han estado las historias de Max y Chloe. Sin embargo, esta elección es para el futuro de la serie. Double Exposure ofrece por primera vez un , permitiendo ver cómo enfrenta las situaciones sin su principal apoyo.

A pesar de no estar físicamente, Chloe sigue presente en la vida de Max, . Vemos una Max que conserva su esencia, pero que ha adoptado rasgos de la personalidad de Chloe, mostrándose más traviesa y social. Max sigue recordando y escribiendo a Chloe, demostrando que, aunque no esté físicamente, sigue siendo su .


marca un hito en la apropiación de Deck Nine de la franquicia Life is Strange, ofreciéndonos un juego que . A pesar de algunos altibajos narrativos, el juego se presenta como una , abriendo puertas a futuras historias que de maneras inéditas. ha llenado un vacío en mi corazón que no sabía que tenía, y me ha dejado sumamente emocionado con lo que venga a futuro."

This new game has an amazing soundtrack, a cool new power, and an interesting story.
I loved the first four chapters, but the last one… not so much, it was disappointing. There were so many plot holes and unanswered questions; important aspects of the story, as well as little details, aren’t explained well and feel inconsistent, which is pretty frustrating.

A lot of people didn’t like what they did with Chloe, but I’m kind of in the middle. I LOVE her, and I’d definitely rather she was in the game, happy and with Max, but I also think the direction they took was realistic and made sense, even if it wasn’t what most of us wanted.

Unlike the other Life is Strange games where I teared up or felt deeply moved, this one lacked the sadness and emotional weight. There were a few shocking moments, and several scenes made me laugh (oh how I love Max's dad jokes and awkwardness), but overall, it lacked the emotional punch they always have.

The choices didn’t feel like they mattered much, but I need to replay it and make different choices to see for myself if there’s actually much difference.

Even though it’s nowhere near perfect, and I’m not sure how I feel about the direction they’re taking, I’m really happy to see Max again and excited for the sequel, I choose to keep my hopes up <3"

Bueno finalice la historia y me quede con muchas dudas que no fueron resueltas.
El juego me encanto, se ve hermoso. La historia me atrapo pero al finalizar el juego me dejo una sensación de vació, como que esperaba un final mas cerrado y no tan abierto.
Sinceramente es un juego que en lo personal lo jugaría solo una vez no le veo la necesidad de re jugarlo.

Si tuviera que ponerle un puntaje sería 7/10.

Veremos como le dan si es que le dan un cierre a las cosas que quedaron sin explicación.

ALERTA DE SPOILERS

Dios mío, lo que hicieron con este juego es digno de felicitaciones. Me hizo sentir como cuando jugué el primer Life is Strange allá por 2015. He jugado todas las entregas posteriores, pero ninguna hasta ahora me había devuelto aquellos sentimientos tan profundos.

HISTORIA

Es fascinante. Desde el primer juego no me emocionaba tanto, como un niño esperando el próximo capítulo y quedándome boquiabierto con cada giro inesperado. Incluso me encariñé mucho con los personajes, que son memorables y con los que conecté profundamente. Están muy bien desarrollados y cuidados, y realmente espero volver a verlos en futuras entregas. Ahora, hablando de Max… ¡cuántas ganas tenía de verla de nuevo como protagonista! Sigue siendo la misma Max que conocemos, pero ahora toma decisiones de manera más madura, ya no es la chica de 17 años que recordamos. Me dolió que el final canónico fuera donde Chloe muere y se salva Arcadia Bay, y cuando comencé este juego pensé que se sentiría su ausencia por ser una continuación directa. Pero no, el juego logra un equilibrio perfecto entre lo nuevo y nos da pequeñas referencias a Chloe en distintos momentos, lo cual es un hermoso toque.

LO QUE ESPERO PARA EL FUTURO

Siento que este juego ha sido un nuevo comienzo, y creo que vienen cosas muy interesantes para el universo de Life is Strange. Con Sofí embarcándose en una búsqueda de otras personas con poderes, ¿será para bien o para mal? Supongo que ya lo descubriremos. También tenemos a una Max que ha aceptado plenamente sus poderes y no teme usarlos. Con un guiño de que podríamos volver a ver Arcadia Bay en el futuro, incluso puedo soñar con que Chloe regrese en alguna forma. Pero, por ahora, es emocionante saber que ""Max regresará"", como mencionan al final del juego.

GRÁFICOS

A estas alturas, el estilo dibujado de los primeros juegos ha sido completamente abandonado, y en mi opinión, ha sido un cambio excelente. El nuevo estilo visual le sienta de maravilla; gráficamente es hermoso. Hay escenarios que me dejaban absorto, se ven realmente espectaculares.

JUGABILIDAD

En esta ocasión, ya no rebobinamos el tiempo con Max, pero el nuevo concepto de sus poderes es muy divertido. Pasar entre universos y entrelazarlos es una experiencia fresca y entretenida. Todo lo demás mantiene la esencia de Life is Strange que los fans conocemos.

Creo que he expresado todo lo que quería sobre este juego. Ha sido una explosión de emociones y felicito a los desarrolladores por crear esta obra maestra. Historia, personajes, gráficos… ¡de 10! Recomiendo este juego totalmente."

LIFE IS STRANGE - DOUBLE EXPOSURE
As a fan of the franchise, LiS-DE is a game you want to love, but unfortunately, it makes it difficult to do so.

The basic game priciples of the series are present in this game - nice graphics and soft music, lots of characters with intertwined stories you uncover over time, a focus on emotions and connection, many choices that can lead to different outcomes and of course a big problem you face with your superpowers.

One important factor to draw the player in, are characters. At its peak, LiS created likeable, memorable characters that many of us still hold dear. Unfortunately, Double Exposure missed the mark here. While there is a whole roster of characters, most of them don't feel quite right or aren't likeable. There's something uncanny in the way the characters look and behave, as they went with a more realistic art style (adding wrinkles etc), but simultaneously made the characters have strange proportions (heads too big for bodies) and have them be very stiff. The dialogues and behaviours often feel cringe, because there's this goofy, sarcastic undertone they added to everything. Some characters, like Safi, constantly pull grimaces and find themselves way more witty and funny than they are. It's painful to watch and makes it hard to care about Safi, which is pretty bad considering her significance in this story.

Another issue where things felt forced is the overly heavy use of . LiS has always been open-minded towards LGBT themes, it was a natural part of the series. You could always romance whoever you liked best, and that's still possible in LiS Double Exposure. But this time they leaned so heavily into this theme, that almost nothing else is left and it just felt forced. Every character is lesbian, gay, bi or trans, checks a few diversity boxes or struggles with mental health/substances. I'm part of the LGBT, and It's nice to have representation, but when your game is pretty much nothing else anymore, then it doesn't feel natural or believable anymore. They really did too much.

Another somewhat connected issue is the way are handled in this new game. Typically, we got to know characters and our relationships with them evolved organically, which made them feel believable. Not so much here. This time, we mostly just get told by the game that we DO like certain characters. The game has already decided for us, that we like Safi and care super much about her. Why? We don't know. We just do. Another example: The game has barely started, and we supposedly like Amanda, the lesbian barowner really much despite not knowing her, and our objective is now to to ask her for a date and do pickup lines on her. We didn't even have any interactions with her, yet, but she's supposed to be our main love interest in this game? The only excuse for this is that this is exactly one of Amanda's personal struggles (liking people too much too soon). But let's be real, it's mostly lazy writing. Same with Diamond or Gwen - the game heavily nudges us towards liking them and caring about them, but ... why? Diamond is annoying and hitting on a person who's not single all game and tries to snatch another character's position. Why would we like her...? One of the few friendships in the game that felt natural was the friendship to Moses, as it grew over time as we got to know him more. This friendship made sense. Amanda did have one or two moments later on that began to form a real reason we might like her, too, although they jump-started it too hard in the beginning. But in a way, it felt like all connections in this game were either assumed by the devs despite of those characters being unlikable or stayed shallow. Sad was, that the game teases chloe and arcadia bay multiploe times in the game, but we never get to see her in person, which considering the abilities characters in the game have could easily have been put into the game (maybe something they plan to do in the next part? Hopefully?)

Another problem was how little our choices seem to have this time around. Sure, we make our choices. But the outcome feels more linear due to them forcing certain parts to set up a sequel. This dulled down the significance of our choices. In the first LiS, our decisions were hard and meaningful. We had to choose between saving our best friend/lover or a whole town of people, and we couldn't have it both ways. In the LiS about the two Brothers, our choices determined what kind of person our gifted little brother would grow into, and which of us would even survive. But this time around, both final choices are leading to pretty much the same result with only minor differences. The story feels okay, but the stakes just don't feel high and decisions don't make enough of a difference.

LiS 1's was intense, and Double Exposure failed to follow in its footsteps. Something went really wrong in the storytelling of the final chapter. We're in the middle of the final escalation, it's building up, we're trying a few small things and suddenly.....! Well, suddenly our character claims something along the lines of ""Daaaamn, I'm so glad we fixed it all"" and everything is fine. I was legit puzzled and thought this must be a hallucination of our main character before we get to the actual resolution of the conflict. But..no. There just is no cathartic, dramatic end at all. It's just over without us doing anything challenging or making a tough choice. Everything is suddenly okay, everyone lives and all that build-up is for nothing and to set up a sequel..and at that, once that gives weight to two unlikable people from this part. That was so underwhelming.

_________________
4 /10

As a whole, this game is the equivalent of getting edged and being told: ""That must've been the best O you ever had!"" But you didn't even come. Sure, the game experience overall was still alright and sometimes fun, but there's a lot to dislike about it too and ultimately you're getting robbed of a proper catharsis. For fans of the series, I think it's still worth playing, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first few games. Still better than True Colors though. I hope the sequel does better than Double Exposure.


P.S.: If you buy it, the base version is likely the best option. Maybe you can get the upgrades on sale later on. I bought the ultimate version, and while extras like the cat outfits etc are cute, they really don't justify the massive price increase"

Early Access thoughts:

I loved the original Life is Strange game. hell I even enjoyed Before the Storm—both games are fantastic. However, Double Exposure falls short in capturing the magic of the first two. The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ part is how they handled Pricefield. Max sacrificed an entire town for Chloe, and yet they had Chloe break up with Max through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ letter?!?! That just doesn't feel true to their relationship, even if they were going through a rough patch. Chloe wouldn’t just give up and leave.

That said, if you set aside that disappointment, Double Exposure has a lot going for it. The graphics are stunning, and the facial animations are some of the best I’ve seen. The story is engaging with a solid cast of characters, but I just didn’t feel a strong connection to Safi, who you’re supposed to care about the most. She doesn’t have the same emotional pull that Chloe had in the original game.

It almost feels like Max wasn’t meant to be the protagonist this time around. However, with three more chapters on the way, I’m hopeful that the game will address these issues and, fingers crossed, reunite Chloe and Max


Double Exposure has some strong qualities, with certain parts of the story being genuinely enjoyable. However, too many plot points felt unresolved, giving the story an incomplete feel. It’s clear they’re setting up for a DLC or sequel, but this focus on future content detracted from delivering a satisfying conclusion. The ending felt abrupt, almost as if it ended prematurely, leaving the story feeling just empty.

Unlike the first Life is Strange games, I couldn’t find myself truly caring about most of the characters. Gwen and Moses stood out as exceptions, but the rest didn’t really resonate with me. The game seemed to push for a connection with Safi. as if trying to replace Chloe as Max’s best friend. but she came across as a forced, half-assed replacement And don’t even get me started on Safi basically trying to forming the Life is Strange Avengers. I also am obligated to bring up Pricefield, which still hasn’t reunited Max and Chloe. This lack of closure around their relationship only adds to my disconnect with Safi and the romance options here, as I still believe Max and Chloe should never have been broken up because it makes no sense for Chloe to just abandon Max because she’s a ""free spirit"".

But enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and moaning about how bad Double Exposure is cause there are some good aspects here. Hannah Telle’s performance as Max Caulfield is incredible; she truly shines in the darkness of this game and is the main reason I stuck with it to complete the game to the end. Max Caulfield will always be one of my favorite characters, and Hannah Telle’s portrayal is a huge part of what makes her great. The graphics are fantastic, with each environment feeling lived-in and real. The voice acting is superb as well the entire cast did a fantastic job.

But I could say a whole lot more, but then this would be a book so all things considered, I would rank this game about a 5/10, and if I'm being generous, a 6/10. I honestly hate to say it because I wanted to like this game, but I simply don’t think they can replicate the magic that the original Life is Strange games had So, if you're a longtime fan or someone who liked Chloe, I would say save your money because you probably won't enjoy this game. However, if you’re a new fan or didn’t like Chloe you might find it enjoyable, but it’s still better to wait for a sale."

I've played all of the LIS games and still really enjoyed this one. I found the ending to be a bit meh but it didn't ruin the overall experience for me."

TLDR: A worthy entry into the franchise that's sometimes masterful and sometimes hot garbage.

The elephant in the room:

Pros:
-FANTASTIC graphics. The freaking pens look photo realistic
-Unrivaled animation and motion capture
-Brilliant acting from all characters
-A REALLY COOL TRANSGENDER CHARACTER!!! :D
-Literally all new characters are just so well written
-Acts 2, 3 and 4 make you REALLY want to know what's coming next.
-Both new love interests are just SO freaking cool.

Neutral:
-New power is pretty cool but really would have been a better addition to her old powers. I hate that both Dontnod and Deck9 REFUSE to use the rewind powers as they were a key part of what made LiS1 a masterpiece.
-other games had already established that other in universe people have powers besides Max and

Cons:
-Extremely inconsistent writing. Most of chapter 1 had me groaning. The intro scene just felt so forced. Like they're trying to make you like Safi but it's just so ham fisted.
-Safi is a well written character but they tell you Max and her are friends rather than showing you. As such a large part of the intended emotional impact of later scenes ends up missing the mark.
-A game about a photographer STILL doesn't have a photo mode... and damn with a game this gorgeous it needs one.
-So few locations. You really just jump back and forth between where Max lives, a bar and the university. Very very little branching out. And while the graphics are gorgeous the scenery is a bit bland. Especially if you live in the north.
-At least one major character from early game just... disappears. Never to be mentioned again for no good reason.
-I spent SO MUCH TIME mad at Max. Some of her decisions in game and pointed to in the past via old texts are just wild and sometimes when you the player should be able to make a decision, you can't.

Ending quality (not specifics) spoilers:

Conclusion: A fantastic and heavily flawed game. I'm not sure I like the direction the franchise is headed but this game right now is good.

Good story, stunning visuals, hands-down top tier animation and incredible soundtrack, as usual.
Playing as Max and seeing her after 10 years feels pretty amazing honestly so if you're a fan of original LiS i think this one's for you.
The story is not something ""out of this world"" lvl but it's fun and very absorbing?
This game really made my inner fan feeling things and I can't wait to see more of Max in the future:)"

Life Is Strange Mixed Feelings

You can see that the developers tried their best: a pretty cool plot idea, a very good soundtrack, atmosphere, graphics are great, characters are well written (not perfect, but it will do), cool mechanics with .

But I specifically did not like the idea of a sequel to the original LiS. I think the first part is a fairly complete, finished work and this game feels like unnecessary add-on.The same applies to the endings: in the first LiS there were two endings and although each player was free to choose between them, I consider the ending where Max and Chloe ran away together canonical (for me at least).

In this game you can kind of change some details that are related to the endings of the original game, but 1. It doesn't change much, the plot of this game will develop anyway and the difference is in small details 2.I have the feeling that the game was designed more for the fact that people chose to and many elements of this game (dialogs, environmental elements (like newspapers)) as if more suited to a certain scenario that the developers themselves chose. Also at the end of this game we have two endings, which differ slightly and that's it. Globally, everything remains the same, the characters from the choice of ending do not change in any way, the choices throughout the game practically do not affect anything, Safi, for example, . And considering that the developers wrote at the end that Max will return - we are waiting for the follow up of this story. I have suspicions that it will feel like an “addon” and that the decisions in this game, which we made ourselves, will slightly affect the events of the “sequel”.

I would like to note that so far there are minor graphical bugs in the game and there was 1 screwed up take in one dialog.

 I have only mixed feelings about the game. The developers tried to come up with something, but it turned out to be quite controversial. To describe the game in 1 sentence: Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a good game if you consider it in isolation from the whole series, but if you evaluate it as a part of the series, it is quite mediocre."

Double Exposure left me conflicted.

On the one hand, it is graphically beautiful and makes good use of a great soundtrack. The dialog is well written and the voice acting generally superb. After my twin initial disappointments at the absence of Chloe from the game, aside from social media posts, and the revision of Max's powers into universe hopping rather than time travel, I wanted to engage with the entirely new cast of characters (including Max's two choices of love interest) and see how jumping between two universes could affect the narrative and the outcome of the game.

On the other hand, despite some really great, oftentimes funny, and occasionally poignant dialog, I found the actual story to be irritatingly opaque for the majority of the game. Though the dialog is well written, almost all of that is not only Max's dialog, it is her internal monologue, her inner thoughts that no one but the player hears. This creates an isolating experience.

Those new powers that seemed so promising, felt quite limited and like they existed solely to include a series of fetch-it quests.

And those new characters felt painfully shallow, becoming even more so over the course of the game because all that universe hopping meant that I was really only spending half the time (at best) with any one version of them. They had no memory of any of the very few meaningful interactions I'd had with them once I switched universes making the creation of real feeling relationships impossible.

Ultimately, it didn't feel like Max's powers had any real impact on the outcome of the story, nor did they leave me with the impression that I'd really shaped that journey. I didn't feel like I'd made my version of Max that reached the digital yes/no endings that all these games tend to have, unlike, say, in LiS: True Colors, where I felt like I'd grown my own version of Alex.

I found this older version of Max much more sympathetic and immediately likable than the original pretentious, sullen, hipster version of the original LiS game. This Max is haunted by her past and has matured enough to understand that there are some things you just have to accept in life. She feels like she's been through a war, which is certainly appropriate, especially if you chose to save Chloe in the first game and let Arcadia Bay be literally blown away.

However, this Max is still an introvert. She's still a loner, despite both her and the story telling us that she has friends at Caledon College. Where Chloe acted as a contrast to Max, breathing life and fun and pathos into that first story, there isn't a character to do that for Max here. Sure, there's Moses, but he's just as much of an introverted nerd as she is. Even worse, she's left juggling two versions of him. Even when she eventually confides her universe hopping abilities in him, it's not at all like when Max shares her time-travel abilities with Chloe which triggers a series of wonderful, bonding moments.

A bigger deal in terms of Max's lack of impact character/true companion is Safi, whose death triggers the whole story. I felt like I barely got to know Safi, and I have to say that I didn't particularly like her. Her death was a shrug to me, with only Max's reaction to it making me feel much of anything about it. In the original LiS, Max never even meets Rachel Amber, who is the big McGuffin of that story, but through Chloe's passionate feelings about Rachel and Chloe being a more sympathetic and generally interesting character, I came to care about what had happened to Rachel. I never really cared all that much about what happened to Safi, which is a big problem since her death triggers the entire Double Exposure story.

Even more problematic is that even though Max claims to be devastated by Safi's death, she spends almost no time with Safi once she discovers that she can switch between the timeline in which Safi was killed and a second timeline where Safi is still alive. For a chapter and a half I grew increasingly annoyed that Max didn't seek out Safi and spend every possible second with her because Max should already have learned that everything is temporary and comes with a price, especially in regard to her powers. In fact, she even states that there's always a price at least once, but seems to ignore her own advice.

I do have several criticisms of Double Exposure, and it certainly isn't my favorite game in the series (that would be True Colors for the way the powers facilitated connection with the characters, as opposed to how the powers separate Max from everyone in Double Exposure by splitting them all into two shallow halves). I still enjoyed my time at Caledon College. For my tastes, Max is well-enough rendered and sympathetic enough that I ultimately did feel for her by the end of the story, even if none of the other characters mattered to me. I certainly understand people giving this game a Thumbs-Down, though, because whether the developers intended it or not, Double Exposure seemed singularly isolating, unlike the original LiS or True Colors, which were all about the protagonist connecting to another (or several others in True Colors) through the use of their powers and growing, as painful as it might have been, for the experience."

The first two chapters are very enjoyable! For those who are unsure of purchasing, I'll list some pros and cons that I personally experienced

Pros (Spoiler Free):
- The game is visually great, and I love the expressions of the characters, though I do admit I miss the style of the old game a bit.
- The in-game conversations seem fairly realistic, and a bit less awkward than the previous games, though, even without the awkwardness, I believe the personality of Max is preserved very well.
- The story so far has been incredibly interesting, to the point I haven't stopped thinking about it, and I want to replay the first two chapters over and over to see all the different outcomes. Additionally, I feel like all decisions carry weight in your gameplay, not just the more ""intense"" choices.

Cons (Spoiler free):
- I have encountered some stuttering / fps drops. Mostly during outdoor scenes, though, there have been a issues during in-door environments, such as delayed loading (assets are missing for split seconds, and one of the characters T-Posed for a moment lol). On the bright side, this isn't the type of game where lag destroys the enjoyability.
- Again, with the graphics, I've noticed the shadows are the most intensive setting, and yet there's only a few settings for optimization (medium, high, cinematic)? I'd love if a ""low"" setting could be implemented in the future, as the performance with no shadows is flawless, yet, incredibly ugly to look at.

Now, I'll name some pros and cons that INCLUDE SPOILERS, so, avoid this next section if you've not played the game or watched gameplay.









Overall, I'm pleased with this game and would definitely recommend it. Fingers crossed the rest of the chapters can hold up to the first two."

This is so good!!

I’ll say it’s only really for hardcore fans of the first game, not really for new player in my opinion but damn, they did a good job I think.

Not worth paying $30 extra to play early tho, that’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice but i wont judge the game based on that fact, and the fact is the game is awesome!

If your a fan of the first like I am this is a must buy"

Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a mixed bag that has some interesting ideas and a promising start but ultimately fails to live up to the potential of its premise and gives signs of trying to steer the narrative of the series in to a direction that at least I am not too excited about.

While it was great to be playing as Max Caulfield again I have to admit that there were multiple moments I found myself thinking that the story they delivered could have also just used an original character instead as it felt that the publisher/management were more interested in using Max as a character than the writers were interested in writing about Max as a character.

That being said, I did enjoy episodes 1 to 3... Just that 4 and 5 weren't great, the gameplay never really evolved or used the parallel times in an interesting way and overall the whole thing was a mixed bag. Do I think it is worth playing? Yeah, why not - it is not a total disaster but I would absolutely recommend waiting for a sale."

As a die-hard Chloe stan, ignore the haters and play this. Yes you'll miss her, and yes it's a little slow starting off (I think it rests on its laurels slightly in the beginning, assuming that just having Max will get and keep our interest rather than working to gain it anew), but it's also worth persevering as episodes 2, 3 and 4 in particular are pure gold. Lovable characters, the plot had me HOOKED (what started as 'cool I'll finish episode 1' turned into an all-nighter to finish it because it was just that compelling), the animations and VA (esp in combination) were TOP tier, really gorgeous, and there was some fantastic cinematography to boot. I wish they would dial down the earliness and frequency of hint lines (and ideally make them player triggered) but that's a nitpick. I had a fantastic all-nighter playing this. Deck Nine has thoroughly earned my trust."

As a loooong time LiS mega fan.. I'm gonna be completly honest and say this is easily the weakest one. Though I really enjoy the new characters and the overall story (gwen is so hot omg) I HATEEEEEEEEEEEE the journal. None of it looks like something max would EVER draw. Seeing how this is waaay after the original, it would only make sense that her drawing skills would've improved instead of going down the weird disney rip off AI looking stuff she is supposedly doing now. I'm also DEEPLY disturbed by the colors and font choices.. I LOLed when max picked up the polaroid and said ""its my handwriting"" GIRL??? HUH???!!! no human writes like that. I'm not saying it has to be actually handwritten but its like they didn't even try to make it look like it.. One of my favorite part of the games is flipping through the journals and reading every single text message to truly submerge myself in the world of the protagonist. (which is why is so upset lol)
The previous games have all nailed the journals and I think its major part of the franchise, so messing it up this bad is DIABOLICAL.. I would also like to add how lazy the bowling alley area felt. It looked beautiful but interacting with it made me cringe. I did not like the organized mess and obvious pathway though it all. I know its in the beginning of the game and maybe meant to ease new players into the controls but jfc.. My main concern is definitely the journal though and I think my dramatic reaction is valid.

pros: MAX IS BACK! FINAL FANTASY OUTFITS!! CAT! HOT BARTENDER!!
I also really enjoy the semi-cringey dialogues. It's a LiS staple and hey, they ARE millenials. Gotta keep the culture alive shaka brah B)

keep in mind that I only played the first two episodes so far, so i'm hoping I can see past the ""handwritten"" font and just enjoy how the story unfolds.. I'll just have to wait around 20 hours for the full game to be out:,)"

I can understand people being annoyed at the fact that the game doesn't respect both endings. But aside from that fact I want to put my piece down so far.

Point one: From the three hours I've played so far, I'm really enjoying how they're setting up plot threads. The PTSD Max clearly has gone under shows, I felt LIS1 vibes from the very moment I hit the menu screen. The music, and just...how max is back nearly made me tear up.

Point two: As much as I'm loving this game so far, I can't deny that Denuvo once again is tampering with how well I can run the game. I'm getting lag spikes, the lighting is going all over the place and it's hard to keep above 40 FPS.

Point three: I've been reading that apparently both endings would be respected but from the first 10 minutes it appears to of scrapped that. I can understand the frustration in that regard, but I'm enjoying this so far, it's got me hooked, and this is someone who didn't play LIS2 or True Colours as they didn't interest me at all.

If you really liked Life Is Strange 1 - You'll love this game, if you can get over the fact the that only one of the endings in LIS1 appears to be canon at this moment in time.

I will update my review if such a thing changes later."

This was pretty much everything I had hoped it was, I really enjoyed playing through this game. It had a good story, really lovable characters (and some not!), and Max was just as awkward as she was in the first game. I know it's getting a lot of negative reviews based on how Chloe doesn't appear in the games, but as someone who chose to save Arcadia Bay in the first LiS; having her appear would have been really weird! I do love how Max thinks about her a lot, though. Even though Chloe doesn't physically appear, you can tell how important she still is to Max. I also felt the new powers were a fun change, and it made dealing with certain parts of the story more interesting. Seeing how low the ratings are for this game currently makes me sad, I feel like it deserves much more than it's getting. I'm looking forward to a continuation to Max's story again in the future!"

Spoilers ahead!

Double Exposure is an interesting game. If you're a Chloe-fanatic, or someone that found the relationship between her and Max to be a central element of your enjoyment of the first game, then you should probably skip this. If you're interested in just more Max, it's a good offering. If you're looking for an intriguing narrative with consistent and believable character motivations...

DE's main weaknesses often interfere with its strengths. Animations and good VA work are often confounded by unclear character motivations, and a mystery that is prolonged by people's reluctance to actually speak clearly to Max. Taking advantage of the two worlds you can jump back and forth between, most of Max's time at Caledon is shaking down someone for information and gleaning virtually nothing of use, then teleporting to the 'Other' timeline and finding evidence and information that compels them to give you something--usually a fact or hint at an event, but rarely anything to go off of until the end of the game.

Most of the faculty at Caledon seem to be comprised exclusively of the most sociopathic individuals in existence. Between Gwen, Lucas and Yasmin, you have three educators competing for the title of for poorly explained reasons. Her book deal is cancelled because Yasmin wanted it to be, for... reasons? Something instrumental to Safi's character growth and a key explanation for her deranged decisions is effectively never plainly explained to Max. I guess Yasmin was just protecting her from being a successful author.

Lucas and Gwen aren't much better. Lucas never takes his plagiarization and contribution to Maya's suicide seriously. Even more damning, by the end of the game he's brushing it off with a half-assed apology and acting as if he's gotten away with it, despite it becoming a public disaster for him just the past chapter. Gwen is just... weird. You have this rebel, 'do things my own way' character secretly cancel Safi's book deal, building up this interesting and somewhat questionable motivation for why someone, especially a mentor to Safi, would do such a thing, but it resolves into nonsense. Gwen was compelled to do it by Yasmin, and goes along with it, despite at any other point in the game talking to Max how she's tired of fighting for herself at the college. Why she does this at all, or why she even listens to Yasmin in the first place is never explained because instead of getting a post-chapter 5 resolution with her like everyone else, she dips out and vanishes.

Lastly, Safi herself is a real piece of work. Jumping from an aggrieved and childish individual acting against those who wronged her to someone suddenly having a joker arc and viewing herself as a supervillian. Half the game I assumed that Safi framed Lucas and destroyed his relationship with his son to get back at her for Maya's sake--instead, when Max asks her about this she brushes it off and says, ""oh I thought he might have had something with my cancelled book deal."" Actually insane. Then you have a direct confrontation with Lucas to assist Safi, because suddenly she remembers that she's supposed to actually care about Maya, which culminates in Safi realizing that her mom is actually hands down life-time winner of ""Worst Mom of the Year"" Award. She actually is the one that cancelled Safi's book deal. Why? Uh, reasons. Reasons that nobody explains to you or Max.

In fact the best antagonist of the game is the most minor and wasted character ever. Alderman, a detective in the Vermont Police Force, is assigned to solve the murder (or suspected suicide) of Safi. Despite only entering into the game in late Chapter 2, and making a comical (mostly wasted) exit in early Chapter 3, Alderman is played off as a paranoid, inquisitive and most of all, suspecting character. From him witnessing Max change aspects of reality, to forcing his way into her cabin home and declare that her entire past history is a story of death, it's clear that Alderman is the first antagonist to realize he's dealing with a supernatural threat. Unfortunately, this is immediately wasted as Alderman deletes himself from existence promptly after (dead serious too it's literally right after the confrontation scene and it's hilarious). Such a waste of a character, as the idea of a detective smart and clear enough to keep on Max's trail and know that something strange and unexplained is happening is a wonderful idea woefully wasted. Detective Alderman definitely could have solved the Death Note case.

Lastly, I know a lot of people are annoyed with the characterization of Chloe in this game, as well as Max's relationship with her, but I think this has left people overlook a far more curious implication. At the end of the game, Max ventures into the storm alongside Safi to fight against two impossible choices (echoing killing Chloe or saving her in the first game). Despite any expectation of consistency with the first game, Max actually manages to rectify everything and save the day, implying that the storm isn't actually a finality. Really it's more like a minor setback.

Which I assume means that Max will just time travel back to Blackwell using the photo she kept, fix the storm, and save both Chloe and Arcadia. Right? Probably not!

7/10 game. Would drunkenly kiss Vinh and form the Avengers again."

I got the advanced access, so I only have access to and played the first two chapters.

Pros
-Graphics are a much needed improvement over the last games. Max looks great, but looks alot different which I could see being an issue for some people.
-Many surprises per usual for the Life is Strange games. Chapter 2 left off on a huge wtf moment and made me eager to play the next chapters when the full game releases.
-The characters are more quick to like and memorable than True Colors. I honestly only remember Ryan and Steph, the other two main characters, from True Colors. The other characters in that game were pretty forgettable and I found myself not caring for them that much. So far in Double Exposure, there are maybe only a couple I don't really care for.
-The new power system they have for the game is pretty cool. I actually prefer it over the time-rewind or emotion reading the previous game had.

-Some of the dialogue choices needed more clarification when choosing them. There were a good amount of times where something came off alot differently then how I thought it was gonna come off. I know Life is Strange has always done dialogue this way, but this was the first time its actually kinda bothered me enough to mention it.
-You can listen to NPC dialogue, and some of it will actually have relevant things you can do that will show up at the end of the chapter when you compare your choices to what other people make. The problem is that this dialogue is pretty buggy. For example, I got too far away by accident and the dialogue stopped. It would not play anymore and I had to reload a checkpoint to get it to play again. I needed to do this because listening to the whole dialogue would trigger something for me to do. There is also way to long of pauses between sentences when two npcs are talking together. If you've played Bg3, think of the long pauses that party members have when talking to each other.
-Politics. Yea yea I know the Life is Strange series has always had politics, but there were plenty of moments were I rolled my eyes. Example being Max saying she hates the statue of the founder outside the school and says something about the patriarchy. Like is that really necessary? There was also another moment where you can see a wall of presidential portraits. The last three are a blond white man, a grey haired white man, and a dark-skinned women in that order. If you interact with the portraits, Max says something along the lines of ""way to be a combo-breaker!"". I may be reading into that too much but given the current political election in the US, it wouldn't surprise me if it was more than just a coincidence.


As stated before, I currently only have access to and have played the first two chapters, so I think it would be unfair to give this game a score as of now. That being said, I enjoyed the first two chapters and im eager to play the full release. I'll update this review if I feel like I need to add anything after I finish the game when it fully releases

Edit: I just finished the game. Ending was great and it set up future games very well. Im pretty psyched with the direction they're taking the story in. I just hope they dont blow it."

-max, where are you going?
-i have no idea, but i'm not making another impossible choice for two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ outcomes

maybe i'm just that big of a fan of life is strange but i do really think this is a perfect sequel for the original game and max's character. i really love the new cast. amanda can peg me if she wants to

also, the ending was very satisfying leaving me very excited for the next entry in the series."

Overall a good game. Different feel than the previous games. First 3 chapters are amazing, last two are... interesting.. Overall, would recommend."

So far I am liking this game. I also am not having the performance issues others are experiencing. My only complaint is how the Chloe/Max relationship was handled. There are more chapters to go and they could still do it justice but I get the feeling nothing is going to come of it. How they handled it was just a kick in the gut to fans. But as far as the actual game/story/ new characters etc., I am enjoying it. The price should be lower but no one has to buy it at launch and full price. Let's see what happens after the next 3 chapters and make a final conclusion."

Since this a Story Based Game I will keep it short.
Finished the game and I had really fun.
This is really a fresh story with potential and I was really surprised at the end.
I really enjoyed it and basically skipped sleeping, unhealthy yes but I still live.
Now I only have 3 hours left to sleep lol"

As a Life Is Strange fan, I liked this game. However, it isn't as deep as the other games in Life Is Strange series. This game makes you feel something, but it doesn't make you cry or anything close to that. Its still a great game to play tho, I would just wait for the sales or when the price is somewhat dropped especially if you arent that big of a fan when it comes to Life Is Strange."

As an older gamer, I do not really care about other players issues with the plot (lack of decisions import from LiS1): Max is back, I love her, she is a young adult but still is romantic and open-minded yet smart and curious. I only played part I and II as a pre-order bonus and I like the new approach to time travel.

The important decisions were unexpected enough so I replayed the first 2 parts to be more in touch with Max and not only with my 'ignorant' view of what is right or wrong because it is unclear, very unclear in the beginning. New characters are well written yet gave me a serious portion of doubts while making decisions.

The plot seems promising and as dark as we can expect of LiS franchise. Graphics are more realistic, the style changed and looks amazing though I adored LiS 1+ & 2 styling. There were a few non-disturbing bugs but it is fine for a fresh release.

Impatiently awaiting 2 more hours for the full release. Love it, love it, love it.

PS I do miss Chloe + Max. As much as Sean + Finn

UPD
thank you very much to everyone who supported my review and even gave awards. Unexpected but humbly accepted. You are too kind, even those who sacrificed a lot to donate jesters."

Note: I played this game on Steam Deck and despite it not being officially supported, it was playable without any issues at all.

Advanced access review:

A proper continuation to the original Life is Strange, this game allows the player to once again take control of Max. Now an adult in her late twenties, Max is teaching at a prestigious university and has been taken under the wing of her grad-student friend, Safi. When Safi is suddenly murdered, Max unlocks a new power: This time she is not limited to rewinding time, but can shift between different realities and timelines. In one, Safi is dead, and in the other, Safi is still alive, but Max must search for clues in both timelines to prevent the killer from striking again.

Only in advanced access right now, I've only played the first two chapters with the final 3 not coming out until the end of the month. However, this game has garnered a lot of controversy and backlash because of the way it handled Chloe. (Spoiler about Chloe but nothing else plot-wise:)

Now that the Chloe situation is out of the way:

This game is a killer. They made it DARK, with morally complex and frankly unlikable characters somewhat akin to the original game. You don't truly know anyone or what they're capable of, and everyone has a ""bad"" side that Max is ready to unravel and learn more about. We're talking affairs, drug dealing, and of course, the murder mystery hanging over our heads. You don't know who you can trust and you come to find that you can't even trust yourself.

They reveal the killer early on, at the end of Chapter 2, and let me just say that the twist is jaw dropping and really solidifies the game as being good and the plot being excellent. I'm hooked and I think its so far the best mystery out of any LiS game, barring of course the original.



After finishing the game, I would say that it maintained its atmosphere throughout much of the game. The pacing ended up having some issue in Chapter 4 + 5, and there was a light tonal shift during the 5th chapter that has ended up polarizing some gamers; However, I maintain that it is an enjoyable edition to the LiS franchise and is a top 3 contender for me.

This game maintains a dark and brooding atmosphere with morally ambiguous, often selfish, characters; It explores the cutthroat underbelly of academia, set on a campus with mind games and power struggles - It's every man for himself and Max is out of her element, trying to make since of this world as she navigates a new mystery and a newly evolved power."

I was wondering how they could continue Max's story from the very first game. They added to her story in ways I didn't even think about. The graphics were beautiful. The story was so good and I was attached to each character I talked to. This is well worth the money if you are into deep stories with impactful choices along the way. I'm excited to see where this story could lead next. GIVE THIS A SHOT YOU WONT REGRET IT."
"Publicada el 21 de noviembre
They put Max's adulthood into the game without spoiling Max, which we know is good to play. But I would also like to see Chloe. The story is interesting and surprising in some places, but I couldn't understand why other people didn't like it. I hope they will fix the optimization problems.

Rating: 8/10 (if Chloe was 10/10)"
"Publicada el 15 de octubre
The game starts out beautifully and gets me right back into that very special Life is Strange feeling. However, the performance is miserable. I know that my PC isn't the strongest but it's decent imo (R5 5600, RTX 3060), yet i have to play on FHD on middle setting with around 30 FPS. I'd like to play at like at least 60 or so, but going lower on the settings makes the game look like a trash-solo-dev-unity-game (iykyk).

Funnily enough: If I restart the game, it runs at around 60 FPS, so if you have a similar PC and have everything on middle but it runs terribly, try restarting it."

I'm very torn with this game, the first 3 chapters are incredibly good, the art, music and writing is amazing. Max's character for the most part is really well written feeling like herself but matured and a lot of the characters are well written and acted and interesting to learn more about.

It is however an incredibly flawed game, I for one don't have a problem with how they handle the Chloe business to begin with (them being broken up actually makes alot of sense especially with some of the hints they have about why) but they never really elaborate as to the actual reasoning and it almost feels pointless bringing her up at all at that point, it seems like they wanted Max's character to be tormented by the decision but never committed to doing so.

Aside from that the story falls short incredibly with the last 2 chapters, the writing feels poorly done and at times is just very confusing and although I enjoyed the game it did feel not great after getting to the end and tbh the way the game is setup you don't really get emotionally attached to Safi so the ending just feels kinda neutral at best and unfortunately kinda leaves you thinking ""what was the point?""

It's really hard for me to rate this I think if you get it on sale and enjoy life is strange it's worth a playthrough but other than that I'm not sure I could.

Conclusion: Max as a character feels refreshingly developed and if you want more of Max you will have a great time & the parts that are great really stand out unfortunately the latter parts that are poorly written make it hard to remember the good and just leaves you feeling sad for what could have been"

This game focuses on Max's trauma from the original. As I would have hoped it definitely has a darker tone to it than the likes of True Colours, it does also improve on True Colours a lot too.

Only Chapter 1 & 2 is available right now so I'll update this review once the full game is out and I've finished it, but in the meantime here are my thoughts so far. The story is good and gripping, definitely the best plot we've seen since the original, without getting into spoilers you'll be exploring max's trauma and of course uncovering a new mystery, unlike True Colours this mystery actually feels important, and it's looking like it's going to have quite a lot of twists as we go through too. It does start pretty slow with Chapter 1, it takes it's time introducing characters and showing off the campus (which isn't a bad thing), and then things start to pick up in Chapter 2. Overall I'm hooked and very excited to see where this story goes.

The choices are also better here (I think), one of my major complaints about True Colours was the lack of real choices, nothing you did mattered and the game was pretty linear. Here I have already made several choices that have come back to bite me in the ass with certain characters. As usual I doubt this will have an affect on the overall plot, but it definitely does highly affect relationships with characters which is great. A certain character is currently very angry with me and no longer trusts me, I'm curious to see how this plays out.

The music so far is great, the menu music is a bit of a weird choice but everything else fits very well, I especially like the background music when you're walking around in a certain timeline, it's a vibe.

Visually of course this game looks fantastic too, again great use of colours between the timelines and the animations here are top notch, it's definitely Deck Nine's strong suit. The characters look great and their facial expressions say a lot.

Now let's talk about some of the issues. First of all performance is a bit off. I can get it running smoothly at 60fps 1440p with everything maxed out except for shadows (medium) and reflections (medium), honestly though I haven't noticed a change in fidelity when changing these settings. It's not a huge issue since it runs well and looks good with those settings turned down, but still I don't think it's the type of game that should need that much power, but idk. There's also no DLSS available which is pretty lame.

The other issue is bugs, there's nothing game breaking here or anything too serious, infact I've only encountered one bug in my 9 hours that's happened on two separate occasions, and that's with doors. For some reason Door's will just float in the air, it's weird but it doesn't break anything. This only ever happens with an interactable door and again, it's only happened to me twice.

Finally it's a minor issue but it's pretty big to me. PLEASE BRING BACK EPISODIC FORMATTING! I don't mean waiting months between each episode, but the way chapters work currently is ""Start Chapter, thrown into the game, get to a climax, chapter end here are your choices"". I really miss the old episodic feel where you'd get a view of where each character was at the end of the episode, and where the story is currently going over a musical montage. Then the next episode would start with a cinematic intro and then you'd be back into it, it's a small thing but I always thought that was really cool and I really hope D9 bring that back in the future, I miss it.

Overall I think this is looking promising. An interesting narrative with interesting choices in an interesting setting, pretty much exactly what I wanted from this game."

It is so heartwarming to play as Max again after almost a decade! The plot twists at the end of the early access chapters really leave you wanting to see more of her story. If you are not an avid Pricefielder and you chose the Bay ending, I'm sure you will enjoy this game. Most Pricefielders are now left disappointed with the way they handled the Max/Chloe relationship following the Bae ending, but I think judgement should be saved until the full game is out.

I love the countless Easter eggs you can find related to the story of Arcadia Bay, there are some emotional text messages/journal entries to read through, and memorable photos. Besides the references to our old adventures, most of the new characters are well-written, predictable at times, yet you begin to empathize with most of them throughout the journey. The new puzzle system can be a bit tedious in some places, but in general I love the concept of Max's new power and the way it works.

There are a lot of collectibles and interactive moments you can easily miss, so be sure to investigate thoroughly! I can't wait for the full game to release; ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah"

I'm a big fan of the Life is Strange series—it's the only series that has made such a strong impression on me, both in terms of gameplay and on an emotional level. I've always missed Max's character, so I'm glad that this new installment continues her story. I appreciate that the creators acknowledged the final decision from the first game, making it feel like our choices genuinely impacted the story.

I've only played the first two chapters pre-release, and I’m not disappointed. I hope the rest of the game remains equally strong, both in narrative and graphics.

Ratings for the first two chapters:
Narrative: 9/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 10/10
Consistency with previous parts: 7/10"

I've only had 2 bugs during the play through, one is the door was standing in the middle of the hallway, the second one is my camera floating in the air(it scared me lmao). I'm using a laptop to play and no lag, don't know why a lot of people saying their games laging."

The first 4 chapters were good but then the 5th just kind of ruined it. It almost felt like your choices and relationships all didnt matter at the end and the same things would have happened regardless. First 4 chapters were fun though so at least 80% of the game is pretty decent."

Сюжет:
История начинается спустя 10 лет после событий первой части уже в новом городе, где Макс преподает основы фотографии. В начале нас сразу знакомят с новой подругой, Сафи. Нам дают понять, что они не разлей вода и сильно дорожат друг другом. В этом плане есть схожесть с Хлоей, но только на первый взгляд. Сафи более рассудительная и сперва предпочтет думать перед совершением действий. В начале 1 эпизода в ходе диалога с Сафи нам дают сделать несколько главных выборов из первой части, включая концовку. В моем случае я выбрал пожертвовать городом и завести отношения с Хлоей. Почему же при данном выборе Хлоя никак не участвует в новом сюжете, вы можете узнать сами, поиграв. Также у нас есть новый друг Мозес, который сильно увлекается астрономией и помогает нам по ходу сюжета. В этот раз главным толчком для обретения новых сил Макс становится убийство Сафи. Спустя несколько дней траура Макс обнаруживает, что способна видеть параллельную реальность, в которой Сафи жила, а позже и вовсе начинает перемещаться между реальностями. С каждым эпизодом возникает все больше поворотов, которые способны вызвать сильное удивление, по крайней мере на меня они сработали. В конце каждого эпизода у меня падала челюсть от увиденного. По ходу сюжета Макс также может завести роман, даже не один. Первая любовная линия крайне милая и заставляет тебя держать улыбку до ушей. Вторая же больше похожа на мелкую интрижку. Сам сюжет я могу назвать менее эмоциональным, нежели первая часть, но это самый закрученный сюжет во всей серии игр, за которым было крайне интересно следить.

Повествование:
У нас все также 5 глав со средней продолжительностью в 3 час, за исключением 4 и 5, они по 1.5ч длятся. Первый эпизод знакомит нас со всеми персонажами и идет очень размеренно, однако диалоги, читка сообщений и местного аналога твиттера не дают заскучать. Начиная со второго эпизода мы уже может использовать силу, что дает нам изучать мир сразу в 2х реальностях. С конца этого же эпизода игра начинает сыпать твистами, что не дает от нее оторваться. Так темп игры с каждой главой все сильнее набирает обороты.

Саундтрек:
Ну и вишенка, это прекрасная музыка, которая делает примерно 50% эмоций. Есть как лицензированные песни, так и написанные к самой игре. Так я уже познакомился с двумя новыми группами и жду полноценный выход всего саундтрека игры. Не могу также не отметить песню, которая играет в главном меню. Она настолько приятная, что ты можешь просто задержаться, чтоб послушать ее. Также отмечу песни, которые играют в момент раздумий на скамейке или кресле, как и в первой части. Они очень качественно подобраны и вызывают нужные эмоции подстать сцене.

Звук:
Со звуком же не все так гладко. Звук сведен крайне неравномерно, местами ты не слышишь окружение, когда идешь по тропе, но резко начинаешь слышать хруст снега. Также голоса могут порой звучать странно, словно не на всех была обработка. В целом же звук терпимый, местами нормальный, местами качественный.

Актерская игра:
Однако плохое сведение звука не помешало актерской игре. Она варьируется от нормальной до очень хорошей, но больше всех, естественно, постаралась актриса озвучки Макс. Ты искренне веришь в то, что она переживает крайне тяжелый период жизни.

Графика:
Сразу скажу, что эта самая красивая игра серии касаемо проработки моделей, деталей и окружения. На максимальных настройках графики игра выглядит шикарно. Также могу отметить выросшую в качестве анимацию, включая лицевую. Она, конечно, не уровня ААА игр, как, например, в играх сони, но явно лучшая в этой серии игр.

Арт дизайн:
Визуальный стиль же больше упирает на реализм, но все еще сохраняет стиль первой части. Игра со светом во многих сценах, включая сцены романтики и всю 5 главу, потрясающая. Свет в половине случаев задает нужное настроение сцене, и здесь с этим все в порядке. Самое главное, что на игру очень приятно смотреть.

Механики:
На замену перемотки времени нам пришло перемещение между реальностями, хотя игра смогла преподнести еще пару сюрпризов. Есть пара мини головоломок. Ну и старая добрая бродилка. В этом плане это классическая первая часть.

Геймплей:
Сам геймплей же представляет собой передвижение по локациям с возможностью видеть происходящее, искать коллекционные предметы и влиять на окружающих персонажей сразу в двух мирах. Игра не успевает наскучить благодаря интересным диалогам, сюжету и выборам, при таком простом геймплее.

Оптимизация:
Оптимизация неплохая, хотя местами фпс просаживался до 30 в некоторых сценах. В целом же не критично."

Biggest issue with this game was the story, I'm really not sure how they managed to ♥♥♥♥ up such a great set up - a murder mystery across multiple timelines has so much potential but unfortunatly the plot loses its focus and decends into nonesense. In one particularly egrigous moment .

The ending was a complete disaster and the entire last chapter sort of just makes the rest of the story and everything set up before meaningless. Questions are not answered, they are deleted.

Max is still amazing and holds the game together, although the writing for her inner thoughts is weak at times, this is extra noticable in the opening scene at the abandoned bowling alley. Safi is a disaster that feels like she was written by two different people who were not allowed to talk to each other. Amanda is completely neglected.

The cast and setting is also generally small, unlike previous entries the game is set in a single university, with only about 7 relevant characters.

Your choices do not matter in this game, almost every big decision has no concequence to the story beyond some different dialogue in one scene before everyone instantly forgets what you did.

Also it runs like ♥♥♥♥. I wish developers would stop using unreal engine 5.

Review update, after the game was fully launched i couldnt even maintain 60 fps at max settings even with a 4090...i was hitting 100+ during EA so no idea what the issue is. Game crashed quite a bit tbh which is odd as i never had this issue during EA and was a bit buggy at times. Dunno if they messed with something when they release it fully as EA was smooth as butter for me tbh. Lastly Safi over Chloe ANYDAY EVERYDAY ♥♥♥♥ Chloe... that depressing piece of garlic. Safi is 10 times more fun. still enjoyed my time playing it. adios haters keep crying about your awful Chloe ending."

""This action will have consequences""

As a long time fan of the franchise, I think the developers took some bold steps with a new power system that feels both innovative and reminiscent of the multiverse-jumping abilities seen in Marvel's Spiderverse.

I also think the option to snap your own photos for collectibles or journal entries adds a unique, immersive touch, while the soundtrack —beautifully curated as always— perfectly complements the story's more mature murder mystery / supernatural thriller tone.

If you've played previous titles, its heartwarming to see Max flourish as an award-winning photographer / guest lecturer.. Although I wished there were more interactions with recurring characters in the franchise, the rest of the new cast are all brimming with personality and they feel fully fleshed out.

However, while the thriller setup and writing are decent, the abrupt handling of the time gap between the current and previous title feels disappointing.

Based on the first game's major ending, , which seems to flow better in the story, though it doesn’t excuse a lackluster handling of .

I'm excited to see what’s next on the full release coming soon, but it’s hard not to think of what might have been, if they had considered the time gap between the titles more thoughtfully.

Definitely a good game but it has some rough edges throughout and an ending that felt rushed and very unsatisfying. Not a fan of the final Chapter in general, I think the story had so much potential but the way the developers decided to go was just not one that I personally liked. Still a game that I enjoyed and I'm looking forward to more."

After following Life is Strange for so long it's really an experience being able to play as Max again. The story this time around doesn't revolve around you or Chloe but this time a new friend called Safi where you basically play detective and figure out her murder while jumping between two timelines. I'm only two episodes in I'm immediately hooked on the story, minor bugs along the way ranging from slight audio issues to A posing NPCs at tables but nothing game breaking. The characters are very likable but for some may be a little...too quirky and may come off weird to others. The graphics are superb and the facial animations this time around are amazing and very detailed. I'm eager to continue the next three episodes and uncover this mystery.

Continuation (SLIGHT SPOILERS):
I have some differences about the game now that I've finished it. The story overall isn't entirely bad but it definitely sets a different speed once you get through episode 3. Starting with the locations, concurrently for each episode we visit 3 locations and by Life is Strange standards that's not a lot at all, it gets very boring very fast and I wish we could explore the entire university since that's where the story hits home but we're secluded to two small buildings and an outdoor area. The location of characters when visiting these areas is just way too convenient as well. How they handled Chloe was not my cup of tea at all. She is not present whatsoever apart from photos and name drops but how they handle her character feels...disrespectful to our choice from the first game if we picked the Bae ending, not only to Chloe but Max as well. There's a point in episode 3 that completely shifts the story, I believed it was going to go; ""two timelines are going to collide and Max needs to find a way to stop it, maybe some people merging into her original timeline""...no, just a shapeshifter spying on Max. Episode 4 just ended so off, it felt very rushed to try and slide home with the big finale they had planned with Safi but it didn't work at all. And then episode 5 just felt more like a trauma dump, going through Max's memories and trying to reason with Safi and the emotions she was processing that felt very out of nowhere, considering she never acted such a way before.

Overall the game isn't bad but it's not good, I stand by my excitement as playing as Max again but the story doesn't hold up and returning to the same 3 locations every single episode was very boring. I really wish the story went the way I was thinking, I'd think it'd amp up the excitement but what they did just felt very...very short."

🌀LET'S THRASH SHAKA BRAH🌀

Seeing Hannah Telle being back as Max Caulfield was a breath of fresh air to the series, as it's been almost a decade since her character was back on the main screens.

The story itself I could say, was mid at best, compared to the previous instalmens of the series. If it wouldn't have had Max featured, I would say the story would be frankly mediocore at best.

Personally, True Colours, to me, was more enjoyable and stable to play than this. *my own opinion tho*

One of my main turn offs, regarding the game, is the semi-forced choices for romancing between two of the side characters. Having to choose straight in the beginning of the game was not my cup of tea in the slightest.

The plot, regarding Alderman, did not situate with my very well, as it seemed to have been brought through out the initial episodes and then to simply be abandoned and forgotten about, as if nothing happened.

I would give Double Exposure a 6/10.
I don't recommend pre-ordering, as I have, as the negatives seem to heavily outweight the benefits.
I am interested on where the series continues, as it mentions that Max will be returning for another installation and hopefully we get more information regarding Chloe!"

This one was a rollercoaster of emotions. It wasn't as strong as the first LiS and it dint really give a clear cut ending. But
I'm planning to re-play the game for the Bae reality. I'll post the review once i finish the game.
Overall it was an 8 in the LiS scale for me."

I absolutely adored LiS 1, and while I understand many of the complaints that people have about this sequel, I genuinely think this was a fantastic addition to the series. As expected with the advancement in tech, the facial expressions and character models are exponentially better than previous titles. Some parts of the story lost me a little, and I didn't quite understand how the resolution came to be (trying to avoid spoilers) but overall, I ended the game feeling content with the 12 hours I spent with Max. It felt nostalgic and just like the first game, I had a blast playing investigator, however, the decisions do not feel as impactful as they did in the first game. In LiS 1, you have two different outcomes you can end up with, but in this installment, it seems no matter what choice you make, it leads you to the same endpoint. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since your choices can change other characters' perceptions of you and alter how those interactions take place throughout the story, but I do wish there were more endings to explore. This game is definitely setting up for another sequel, which I will gladly welcome with open arms, but I just hope that a lot of the decisions we made in this game can carry over to that and continue growing with Max (the romance, for example).

As for the elephant in the room, I had chosen the bay ending in the first game, so I felt that my playthrough made perfect sense and aligned with what I expected to happen after the ending of LiS 1. With that said, I don't feel that I can make a proper critique on how they handled the bae ending until I go through and replay the story with that choice.

My final crticism for this game falls on the romance capabilities. This has always been a very fun side objective in all the LiS games and it's no different here, however, I detest the fact that you sit through an entire scene, have the option to romance someone, and then there are no more interactions afterwards. You can lightly flirt throughout the first few episodes with one of two characters, but it's only in episode 3 where you can actually make a move (or not). Beyond that, there really aren't any more opportunities to hang out or talk with that person. I know this isn't the point of the game, but if you're gonna make it an option, I think there should be multiple chances where you can grow and explore that as an *optional* side objective. As I mentioned before, I'm hoping that with the sequel that's implied to be happening, we can actually carry over all the choices that were made and develop these relationships further.

Final thoughts:

The story was unexpected and I found myself enjoying it and following it pretty easily. Besides some minor plotholes and unexplained decision-making by the characters towards the end, I really loved seeing Max again in all her glory. Her inner monologue was always one of my favorite parts of LiS 1 and I felt that they kept that same heart in this sequel. She felt like the same Max, albeit slightly different facial design, and the dialogue throughout the game came off as realistic and not forced. Her new power was fun to use and I enjoyed discovering the little side objectives you could do like watering plants, helping other characters, etc. The end chapter screen, as always, is a fun way to see what other players are doing in their playthroughs and I enjoyed comparing my choices with theirs! I am optimistic for the future of LiS, and I believe Deck Nine did a great job overall with this sequel. I can't wait to see what Max will do next ♥"

Honestly, I really really loved this version of Max.
She is the best.


Overall, this game was fantastic!!"

Absolutely fantastic game so far! Really intrigued to see where the story is going after the events of the first two episodes.

Have played through and loved the other LiS games and am loving this one so far as well. My canon choice from the first game was Bae and I felt like they have handled that ending well so far in Double Exposure. Especially considering the amount of trauma that comes with making that sort of choice. People seem to think it's all sunshine and rainbows after sacrificing thousands of people. Let alone what that does for the person you save. They've handled it will so far considering the two of them were in high school when all of those events occurred. To each their own though.

There are some minor bugs that I've encountered so far and hope that they end up patching those out by the time the full game releases this upcoming week. Hopefully there aren't any major bugs with the full launch. Outside of that, the characters are great, the dialogue is fun, and there is more mystery to this game than previous ones. Here's to hoping that they are able to pull off the ending with what has been set up so far. My review could very well change if it falls flat.

But if you like choice driven games and have enjoyed all of the Life is Strange games, then you're in for quite a treat.

After completing it, I still love the game but for different reasons from other LiS games. Isn't my favorite in the series but is still a very good game. Also, the soundtrack is beautiful and incredible like other LiS games!"

lmao! People so upset about the whole Chloe thing, but since there were 2 endings to the first game, it would make no sense to have a completely different story line in the game with Chloe present, and one story line without her present....I personally chose to sacrifice her in my play through, since I couldn't justify sacrificing thousands of people for one person. Also, we only have access to the first 2 chapters, and in the first chapter alone there was several references to the whole Arcadia Bay/Chloe thing surrounding her death for me, since I chose that option in this game, but you would hope if you chose the option that they grew apart/broke up that there might potentially be an appearance at some point in later chapters. But I've been enjoying it so far, and find it slightly ridiculous people are refunding solely for the reason that Chloe isn't in the story, but it wouldn't work considering the 2 different endings in the fist game."

OMG what a game so far, the first 2 episodes are incredible.

These games are just something special & you can tell the devs put alot of love into them, i love the series excluding LIS 2 sadly but if you love these games then please buy it ASAP as you will not regret it.

End game update - Really great game but wish it was a bit longer, i do miss the old character tho like Kate,Steph,Alex etc but for me this is a solid 9/10 also True Colors still remains my favourite in the series !"

Max has matured over the decade but still feels like herself, much like the game. The mystery is just as interesting as the first's and I find her new power even moreso."

I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging and stimulating the story was after reading all the reviews.

I think this game is loyal to the first and the series, but the lower reviews are due to a new generation of gamers.

This game is a lot of fun, and Max is still Max, just older and wiser.

I really liked this game. :)"

The game is good so far. Not great. But it's good. I don't really think that the ultimate or deluxe edition is worth the price, I'd say that if you really want to play it, just save yourself the money and buy the regular version. I only really bought the ultimate edition to avoid spoilers and such. Anyways, the graphics in the game are good (I still prefer the original graphics, but the graphics in this game are still good) and the storyline so far. But... I don't agree with how they said they would 'respect the two endings.' I didn't feel like the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending was respected at all(at least if you had chosen to romantically pursue Chloe, like I did.) I have mixed feelings about this game for sure. Because while I do sadly feel like its partially a cash grab, I still enjoyed the game so far (other than the other reasons and some glitches here and there, as to be expected with newly released games). If you want to enjoy the game but don't feel like wasting money, save yourself the hassle and watch a playthrough. But if you want to play it yourself like I did, that works too. I don't regret buying the ultimate edition and playing it for myself, but i do overall feel like it's not the best decision"

Plot Is Strange: Double Exposure..

The game is visually great, the characters are perfectly expressive and I was able to recognize the studio's taste for detail and their fine writing of each character, more specifically Max who remains faithful to the one we know from the previous games. On the other hand, the story left something to be desired, with certain narrative elements seeming very unsubtle, even crude, which is regrettable compared to the first Life is Strange games. The story seemed blander than the others, there was a lack of impact on the possible choices, and the consequences were almost negligible. I still recommend because it felt like a good experience but it was not worth €49.99 (or even more with the two extra DLCs)."
