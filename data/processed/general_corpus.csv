just finish the last episod littl bit ago and honestly this is som of the worst writing i 've ever seen in gam her are som of my main issu spoilers ahe why did n't max the pictur of herself with the when back was turn was n't looking at her the whol tim she could hav easily it into her is she stup ther is up to safi 's mom `` '' '' '' her it just happens out of the blu with furth context giv about her about safi 's or the deal why is ther anoth storm it seems lik the writers of this gam completely misunderstood why the storm was in the first gam the first gam is all about the effect how small choic can to big chang the storm was n't caus by max 's powers it was caus by chlo being aliv ther is reason for the storm to com back other than as nostalgi bait and lazy attempt at trying to mak things mor why did safi even want max to her in the first plac i feel lik it was not mad cle at all and if she want to die so badly to prevent whatev she thought was going to happ why did n't she just do it herself so that max would n't get for her death and why did she tak phot that she knew would max and why would they tak the from luc 's if they wer trying to prevent max from ever safi are they stup the choic you mak throughout the gam hav basically impact and ther is one ending lin all of the to lis felt so and once alderm dies it 's that one him and it seems lik it 's going to be kind of big deal but it 's nev brought up again also the fact that max can basically help him seems completely out of charact they do n't even to bring this up ever again why is everyon is so horny for max in this gam why was the `` '' nightmar '' '' sequenc real event that actually happen in the first gam it was mad cle that it was just nightmar in max 's mind but her everyon can see what 's going on it also mak sens that max and safi just right into the storm max 's new ability to from one reality to anoth could hav been cool gam play mechanic but it 's only ever used twic in cut scen the cat content is cut is n't worth paying extra money for terribl cash grab from squar why did bloom in the of safi 's ther 's not even clu as to why that happen the sid characters are bland and i could not car less about most of them giving max the option to offer is extremely out of charact and is lazy option for the final choic safi evil does not mak lot of sens lik most of the gam it lacks and seems to com out of why is ther som third timelin wher all the are coming from i 'm sur i could writ lot mor but i 'm and ready to be over this gam do not recommend playing at all you will be disappoint just finish finished th the last a littl and honestly honestly this this is some of of the the worst i 've 've ev ever s in a some of of my spoilers ah why did did n't with th was n't at her the whol could hav there is is no up to to safi safi 's `` '' '' '' it just out of of the with n about h safi 's why is is ther it seems seems lik like th the writers of this this gam why the the storm was in in the the first first gam game th the first first gam game is all about about th the storm was n't max 's 's powers powers it it was there is is no no reason reason for for th the storm to com come back other th as a and a trying t to mak make things why did max t her in in the the first first plac i feel feel lik like it it was was not at all all and if she wanted t to di so badly to prevent was going going t to happ why did did n't do it that max max would would n't n't get for h and why why did take  a phot that sh max and and why take th if they they wer trying t to prevent max from the choic choices you you mak throughout th the gam game hav and ther there is all of of the to lis it 's no on him and and it it seems seems lik like it it 's going t to b kind of of a a big big deal but it it 's brought up also th the fact fact that that max max c out of of charact they d do n't n't ev why is everyone is is so for max max in in this this gam why was was th the `` `` '' '' nightmar '' '' happened in in the the first first gam game it it was that it it was was just just  in max max 's but her can se see what what 's on it it als makes n no sens that max max and and safi into th the storm max 's 's new ability t from on to anoth could hav have b been  but it it 's 's only the cat cat content is n't cash grab why did in the safi 's there 's 's not not ev the sid side characters characters ar bland and i could most of of them max th out of of charact character and and is is a for th the final final choic does not make  a lot lot of sense lik most of of the the gam game it seems t to com out of why is is ther timeline wher all the i 'm i could a lot more but but i i 'm to b this gam game d do not not recommend at all you will will b,negative
i want to appreciat works for what they are rath than them for what they ’ t so when i this gam would not be about i still deck nin to deliv an interesting continuation of max caulfield ’ s story howev they seem to disrespect the original gam throughout doubl exposur ther wer elements of the gam i enjoy max ’ s new pow wher she can mov betw thes two realiti is fun and i found myself confusing the two versions of characters in the story this was by design and quit fun to keep of this pow nev com clos to the of other lif is strang powers even doubl exposur struggl to find its ther are so many different on and they don ’ t into characters from the first gam are still represent by the charact whil max caulfield is real being max ’ s diary look and cold when we and the limit numb of sets this gam all look lik they could in any other gam caledon lacks the charm of even from tru colors and most of the environments would look in plac in gam lik ps despit this the earli chapters wer still pretty enjoy the mystery is interesting and kept through chapt though i was by how horny every charact in this gam is it was especially out of charact for max but even in the other characters it was just both romanc options are so ther are good new romanc options it 's in the final two chapters wher deck nin the narrativ the gam hints for most of the gam that this seems lik of what the first gam for and then the sets in they want to this franchis for every they can this is the first tim i hav not been excit about the futur of this seri the majority of the characters in this gam don ’ t get spac to in meaningful ways exploring max ’ s traum is the most interesting thing this gam does but ther are only of scen wher this is don in ways it felt lik deck nin had murd mystery writt and then decid to max ’ s traum at few points to justify bringing her charact back what is how this gam to upset its cor they brought back max caulfield which is fan servic but they seem to disrespect the in several ways making this gam less to original fans i was even on for this this could ’ ve been “ the last of us part ” style of off the fans writing meaningful story even if it mak fans but then in the ending they this read as cle attempt to profit off of the fans which i was already of giv the natur of the edition but if they wer just in it for the money why wouldn ’ t they go all the way with fan servic why did they even if they knew this upset numb of the fans why mak both of the romanc options do they want to from the original and start new one with doubl exposur i want this gam to be good mor than any gam i 've play in years and i ’ ve away things i enjoy but this is the worst gam in the seri i hop they can correct cours for the futur but my hop are n't high hannah tell was great though i want want t for what what they they ar rather th for what what they ’ t when i this gam game would would not not b i still deck nin of max max caulfield ’ s s story the original original gam double exposur there wer elements of of the the gam game i i enjoy max ’ ’ s new pow where sh she c fun and and i i found found myself the tw versions of characters in in the the story this w to keep of this other lif life is is strang double exposur to find there ar are s so many and they don ’ ’ t into  characters from from th the first first gam while max max caulfield caulfield is is a max ’ ’ s when w and the this gam game h like they they could in any true colors colors and most of of the in a a gam game lik the earli chapters wer the mystery mystery is though i i was character in in this this gam game is it was out of of charact character for for max but ev even in in the the oth other characters characters it it was was just romance options options ar there ar are n romance options it 's in the the final two chapters deck nin the narrativ narrative th the gam most of of the the gam game that that this seems lik like  of what what th the first first gam and then then th they want

that great performanc pretty graphics and soundtrack ca n't carry or sav gam from its writing it 's not just bad writing it 's and and ultimately disrespectful to the original gam wher the betw max 's are at best and at worst if ther was anything about max 's story i did not find it becaus ther was nothing said or about max 's from her previous beyond what felt lik very shallow `` '' get over it and mov on with your lif '' '' i lov hannah tell returning as max it 's just how much of disservic doubl exposur feels lik to hannah as max as belov charact and even dontnod and the own gam that start everything in the first plac you do n't feel any weight or consequenc to the choic you mak in this gam to the point wher the ending the choic you mad simply taking the easily moments to in levels this was just into your play charact 's mind in every other gam but her it 's gameplay treat lik choic that will impact your gam in any way when it absolutely does n't it 's baffling small decision that really gets to the heart of the issu the peopl behind this gam hav really misunderstood what mak lif is strang with fans to what i said in the first spoilers btw ther is strong that one of the original endings is as the obvious good choic whil the other gets look down on as doubl exposur asks `` '' well what did you expect '' '' how both endings of the original are about the consequenc of your actions and how you choos to it lis did n't end feeling lik you wer choosing betw right and wrong but not only it lik you wer with the writing following being giv mor respect and than but even ends itself with choic betw the obviously right path that max would choos giv what she 's been through and the obviously wrong path that after everything feels so out of charact for max especially within the narrativ of this very gam as of my finishing the gam it 's som kind of that the majority of players at the tim chos what feels present as the wrong `` '' evil '' '' path non of the gam so far in the seri hav felt lik choosing betw good and evil with doubl exposur and its for futur gam i 'm that new will start wher we wo n't get what mad lif is strang such seri and it 's all down to big of why peopl lov the original seri so much if you 're fan of previous in lif is strang or even just the first gam doubl exposur the mark and after the first coupl of chapters which might explain why thos first two chapters wer mad avail early to up the gam befor the full rel characters and the moments in the story feel and underwhelming and caledon somehow feels so with how much it the sam levels and are over and over which did n't feel lik problem in lis or tru colors thanks to chang in tim of day and environment the murd mystery the marketing on only the first two chapters and from ther it on the supernatural to get away with weak storytelling and an ending that feels so for lack of bett way to put it this is the first gam in this franchis wher i hav completely my purch it 's just massiv disappointment if you hav any about doubl exposur wait until it gets big pric in sal this mad mor to put my in what the new developers teas and wheth to buy futur gam in the seri ps the cat content is too minimal to justify the to the pric it feels lik it was meant to be in the gam as you ca n't achievements without it so if you want som minut of max being cat person wait for the dlc to go on sal too graphics and and a ca n't a gam game from writing it it 's 's not writing it it 's and ultimately disrespectful t to th the original original gam where th max 's at best if ther there w max 's 's story story i i did did not there w about max max 's from h felt lik like  a very `` '' over it it and move on with your '' '' '' i i lov love hannah hannah tell as max it 's 's just how much of a a disservic double exposur feels lik like t as a as a character and and ev and the their own own gam game that everything in in the the first first plac you d do n't n't feel to th the choic choices you you mak in this this gam game t to th the point point wher where th the ending the choic choices you this w was just just  in every game but but her here it it 's 's a like  a choic that will game in in any any way when it does n't it 's 's a to th of the the peopl this gam game hav life is is strang what i in the the first there is is a a strong one of of the the original as the the oth on as double exposur `` '' did you '' '' both endings endings of of the the original of your and how you choos did n't feeling lik like you you wer not only like you you wer with th the writing but ev with  a choic between th that max max would she 's and the feels s so out out of of charact character for for max the narrativ of this game  of my the gam game it it 's 's som some kind kind of that th majority of at the the tim as the `` '' '' '' none of of the the gam so f in the the seri felt lik double exposur and its games i i 'm that  a new wo n't n't get life is is strang such  it 's to  a big loved th the original so much if you you 'r a fan fan of in lif life is is strang just th the first first gam double exposur after th the first couple of first tw two chapters chapters wer up the the gam before th the full full rel characters and and the in the the story feels s with how how much the sam over and and ov did n't n't feel feel lik like  in lis true colors thanks t murder mystery the first first tw two chapters chapters and on the to get and an an ending ending that that feels feels s lack of of a way t to put this is is the the first first gam game in in this this franchis where i i hav it 's 's just just  a massiv if you you hav have any double exposur until it a big in a a sal this h made m to put what th the new in the the seri the cat cat content to justify

it to writ this do n't get wrong ther is lot of stuff about this gam that i lik the first lik and half episod wer in my opinion perfect but the major reason i 'm saying i do n't recommend this gam becaus it 's lik they forgot they had to finish it starting through chapt the quality and lik the of the gam went way down and then in chapt it the last episod and the ending wer writt and mad sens this was the most badly writt ending that i 've ever seen not to mention ther is lik gameplay in the last chapt the rest of it being really terribl littl scen of that quickly cut to black and just go to anoth scen of that the ending mak it feel lik this entir thing should hav been safi 's story and not max 's lik it mak sens for the first chapters we play and it 's lik it 's the ending of different gam entirely also your choic really do n't matt action will hav consequenc it probably wo n't that was an issu in the original too i wo n't lie but this one is even mor and yes lot of thes negativ reviews are about chlo not making an despit max throughout the gam i too am disappoint about it especially becaus the ending was so bad in general but if they would hav just mad the ending good by making it ending they put tim into i would n't be too mad about her not up but at the end they really do teas the play into thinking she was going to show up just to throw it away and i know why at the end of the gam you get scen which off follow by black scre that says max caulfield will return so they just did n't finish this gam becaus they 're going to mak anoth one i 'm sorry i paid for this gam to be finish not to pay anoth on anoth gam despit all this ther are things that i lik about this gam graphics are good as long as you mess with the settings voic acting having the original voic for max was hug even though her ending left much to be lik being able to control the and actually tak the pictur in gam i really look forward to doing anoth run of the gam until i got to the end it everything i wish they would see how much we hat it and giv this gam an actual ending but they 're just going to put that in anoth gam so i can not recommend this gam only buy it on sup sal if you 've play the original and if you 're okay with the fact that the ending will be the worst ending you 've seen sinc how i met your moth me t to writ do n't n't get get m me wrong there is is a a lot lot of about this this gam game that that i i lik like th the first and a in my my opinion but th i 'm i do do n't n't recommend recommend this this gam game becaus because it it 's 's lik like they they h had t to finish chapter th like th of the the gam and then then in in chapt the last episode and and the the ending this w was th the most badly writt ending that that i i 've 've ev ever s not t to mention there is in the the last chapter th the rest rest of of it of that to black and just to anoth of that that th the ending feel lik like this should hav have b safi 's 's story story and and not max 's 's lik like it it mak makes n no sens for th the first played and and it it 's 's lik like it it 's 's the the ending ending of of a a different your choic do n't n't matt will hav have consequenc wo n't that w in the the original wo n't but this this on one is is ev even mor a lot lot of of thes throughout th the gam game i about it because th the ending ending w was s so b in general but if if they they would would hav just mad made th the ending it a i would would n't n't be about h but at at the the end they really the play she w was going going t just t to throw it away and i i know at the the end end of of the the gam game you you get get  by a max caulfield caulfield will will return so they they just did n't this gam game becaus because they they 'r going t to mak one i i 'm 'm sorry sorry i for this this gam game t to b not t another gam there ar things that that i i lik like about about this this gam graphics ar are good good  as you with th voice acting the original for max max w even though much t to b able t take th game i i really forward t of the the gam i got to th the end i wish they would see how how much it and give this this gam an actual ending but but they they 'r 're just going t to put another gam game s no i i can can not not recommend recommend this this gam it on sale if if you you 'v 've play played th the original if you you 'r with th the fact fact that that th the ending will b be th the worst you 'v,negative

lif is strang and disappointing at tim i ’ ll avo heavy spoilers in this although it 's hard to do so her goes nothing first i for the “ bay ” ending i believ it serv as mor story for the them this gam is meant to explor howev the fact that deck chos to both endings was mov and choic i ’ ve only seen how things progress through the first two chapters with this ending but even at that i 'd buy that deck may not hav been able to do it it ’ s not that i couldn ’ t believ max and chlo might part ways in fact considering they over traum of ways could becom not still exploring the of such relationship would serious narrativ and i ’ m not deck could deliv that but i ’ ll myself out of that as it ’ s the least of the issu with the gam 's overall narrativ the first two chapters are don which is interesting to see that enix let peopl play thos two early n't it you can explor the and shift betw two timelin the living and the dead the living timelin with music and an overall sens of in contrast the dead timelin is cold distant and yet weight although som of the of the original lis gets lost her deck in strong contrast betw thes two realiti the puzzl are tho not as you around and reveal information by using both timelin versions of the characters and out how the levels do chang and i the murd mystery through characters ’ liv motivations and at that of the gam felt genuinely engaging and the cast seem enough caledon didn ’ t feel much than or other parts of arcadi bay but the mad it feel as step up i expect to experienc of tru colors and the original for whil it work until it did n't and apart badly the plot being lis story becam but it did so in the worst possibl way with littl about it the pacing strong becom up whil down by without even the achievements becom as you of the sid are and achievements are into the first two chapters with the third off and by chapt you ’ re on mor lin path even the social medi text messag and your own journal becom and did they things perhaps but whatev the reason it leav deeply experienc compar to heavy of lis and befor the storm doubl exposur is just bland though max gets to hav moment of resolv hints at something which is fin but it it in shallow way with “ max caulfield will return ” in reality though is hardly cool i just wish they had how lacking the major antagonist is they fall jefferson ’ s dark in the first lis inste ’ s big reveal seems to be that som peopl are just deeply fact that requir real writing to mak meaningful to creat an antagonist with high despit the actions is small and deck falls short ther i rememb peopl the first gam ’ s ending but it was meant to eith com full or it completely her ther ’ s and the final choic is sinc it only sets up the next along with your romanc interests in short as mystery mor mor and then into absolut with the gam does disservic to both its cast and even to max herself one of the most genuinely charact the antagonist should in hav meaningful contrast to inste the story bringing out them of the real pow is the personality we get simply poorly execut and mess so they can it out mor heavy spoilers the to the original lis are present with rachel and chlo by may and safi max ’ s of chlo at her chlo ’ s with her and i can see simil with safi who with max whil still by her past safi ’ s natur only when she asks max to her caus at the very end and that point she seems lik type of she for part of the and though she seems her motivations seem compar to chlo feels and relat safi ’ s motivations and actions don ’ t add up her struggl are and with littl to justify her beyond being as “ evil ” even the damag by her distant the of her to her by her own handl chlo was yet by her moth fair but who did she had as friend on the other end safi had mos and friend who was clos to her even befor max so why does safi tak this path inste of we ’ re left if to safi ’ s head wouldn ’ t hav mad mor end to the that not everyon is meant to be sav the cas of alderm seems intriguing and at first but then literally how does this work why do max and mos rememb him will we ever get answers who what ’ s cle is that without him the gam that is baffling becaus the gam gets rid of him when it does n't need him then why hav him to peopl off from what then ther ’ s amand one of the few characters she asks to tak break becaus of what to up the gam how may meant to parallel rachel is anoth miss unlik the original isn ’ t around may the way lis around rachel she ’ s just anoth sid plot to luc ’ exposur trying to justify safi ’ s the lack of depth in safi ’ s combin with the of serious is she shot at her moth and the gam barely ther everyon on and seemingly be ok with it sol safi gam could hav been would creat som sort of tension allowing us to explor her relationship with her moth whil safi would her natur then she max we get this in which ther could be an option for safi to eith herself or into the storm how seemingly compar to tim i mean pow can

review it 's very sad to see what decknin don with my favorit gam franchis first of all i ’ ve been following the marketing of this gam sinc it was and besid all the being uninteresting and all the sam the developers even when they said they would “ respect the both endings of the original gam ” after whil i about spoilers as everything about the gam 's marketing was entirely uninteresting so i went looking for what was really going for thos who lik sav chlo in the first lis the last words of the gam wer chlo and max each other they would stay togeth but now in this gam right from the first minut of gameplay you ’ re forc to end max and chlo ’ s relationship in way that completely both max and chlo ’ s characters as well as the fans choic to sacrific an entir city to sav her from that point on chlo does n't even to say singl the best we get are messag so that it hardly feels lik her on the other end of the they didn ’ t even creat charact design for chlo the gam 's is completely lazy as the developers go out of the way to that the two endings of the first gam hav impact on this one ’ s narrativ making the storylin almost regardless of the choic mad in the first gam speaking of the the of max and the supp chlo 's is at this point i ’ m very disappoint with the narrativ who despit not being part of the first gam in my opinion did great job on lis befor the storm and what ’ s up with thes completely forc it seems lik even if you say you only want friendship with thes new characters the gam constantly tri to you into som kind of relationship with them in timelin wher chlo is aliv the least i expect was som respect after the first don ’ t nod the original creators of lis gav us the choic to decid the ending of the first gam choic wher players could the and decid the ending then decknin cam along and took that choic from us in an way at the end of this gam one of the characters hints at the of chlo returning in the next gam but having to wait years for something that they wer to show now is also disrespectful to fans if lik you sav chlo in the first gam i recommend reading the comics and them as canon even if you don ’ t think the comics are perfect they wer at least mad by peopl who truly lov the lif is strang franchis as for thos who didn ’ t sav chlo if you 're with max and gam premis that powers over storytelling and characters go ahe and enjoy for the best this gam to offer are beautiful graphics and soundtrack the and emotional storytelling that is the of the first gam is far from being well represent in this one as the feeling after this gam is simil to how it felt at of the world against on our when we wer down now we ’ re into the second “ max caulfield will return ” i just hop that this tim we at least get the lik in that it 's to se see what my favorit of all all i i ’ ’ ve ve b been following following th the marketing of this this gam since it it was all the all the the sam the developers when they they s said they they would respect th both endings endings of of the the original original gam about th the gam game 's so i for what what w was really for thos those wh like m chloe in in the the first first lis the last of the the gam game wer chloe and and max each oth they would in this this gam from th the first first minut minutes of you ’ ’ re forced t max and and chlo chloe ’ ’ s in a a way max and and chlo chloe ’ ’ s as well well  as the the fans to sav save h does n't n't ev to say the best we get that it feels lik like h on the the oth end of of the didn ’ ’ t t ev create  a charact for chlo chloe th the gam game 's as the the developers out of of the way t that th the tw endings of of the the first first gam game hav have n on this this on ’ s making th regardless of of the the choic in the the first first gam speaking of of the of max max and and the the supp chloe 's at this this point point i i ’ ’ m very disappoint disappointed with with th the narrativ part of of the the first first gam game in in my my opinion did  a great great job before th the storm storm and and what ’ s up with with thes it seems seems lik even if if you you only with thes new characters characters th the gam tries t you int some kind kind of relationship with with them them in in a timeline wher chloe is is aliv the least i expect after th the first don ’ ’ t the original original creators of lis the choic the ending ending of of the the first first gam game  a choic in an at the the end end of of this this gam one of of the the characters at the of chlo in the the next next gam game but for something something that that they they wer is als disrespectful t like m chloe in in the the first first gam game i the comics comics and even if if you don ’ ’ t the comics they wer at least made by people wh love th the lif life is is strang for thos those wh didn ’ ’ t save chlo if you you 'r with  max and and a a gam and characters for m me th the best this gam game h graphics and and a that is is the of the the first first gam game is from being in this this on as a after this this gam game is how it it felt of the the world when w we ’ ’ re into th the second “ max max caulfield caulfield will will return i just hope that that this this tim at least like in in that,negative

this gam wants to just throw away decad long relationship for us fans and relationship that years in univ the first minut well expecting you to mov on immediately to new relationship with that i don ’ t giv sh t about well also chlo as charact with her saying that she doesn ’ t max to not use her powers that she doesn ’ t even know if she can use they did not respect the ending of the first gam most of us sacrific entir town for chlo for max and chlo s relationship and they threw it away lik it was nothing graphics are good the outfits are not worth paying for environments feel at tim characters are and annoying other than safi encounter coupl bugs i would not recommend this gam to any fans of lif is strang this gam wants t to just throw away a decad and a a relationship relationship that the first first minut you t to mov move on to  a new relationship with with  that i i don don ’ ’ t sh t chloe  as a a charact with h that sh doesn ’ ’ t max t her powers that sh doesn ’ ’ t t ev know if if she she c they d did not not respect respect th the ending ending of of the the first first gam most of of us for chlo chloe for for max max and and chlo and they it away like it it was graphics ar are good good th outfits ar are not not worth at tim characters ar other th a coupl i would would not not recommend recommend this this gam game t to any fans of of lif life is is strang,negative
updat i the gam the gam literally does n't hav an ending nothing gets resolv the gam just ends this gam is positiv the gam looks pretty music is very good hannah tell is giving it her all and mos is genuinely likeabl negativ the gam absolutely hat you if you pick sacrific arcadi bay and does everything in its pow to the characters with out of charact writing in the most ways even multipl things about thes characters the developers promis of “ both endings ” was lie unless you and on someon ’ s as an act of respect this would be bad enough if it was just in the beginning but the gam is on you throughout the overall writing is also full of very forc jok including `` '' '' '' `` '' '' '' guy trying to max into at work becaus it 'd be `` '' sexy '' '' guy is romantic option btw personally i need to speak with about him and som other during texts it 's not charming in the slightest several audi bugs peopl lik they ’ re in different room when they ’ re right in of you twic whil playing it and sinc your can ’ t skip it ’ s to get back to wher you wer had anoth wher you are supp to open lock after the the open on its own and i could see everything of it even though i was that i need to find the key the feel incredibly forc the gam is with forc sexual jok and the charact vinh is romantic option and com off as nothing but overall if you are fan of dontnod ’ s original titl and its sequel to an this gam is not for you if you sacrific arcadi bay it does everything it can to what the of thos gam the ending meant with the gam game th the gam does n't n't hav an ending the gam this gam game is is a positives th the gam game looks music is is very very good good hannah hannah tell all and and mos moses is the gam if you arcadia bay everything in power t out of of charact in the the most things about characters th the developers both endings was  unless you ’ s as an would b if it it was was just in the the beginning but th the gam game is throughout th writing is is als `` '' '' '' `` '' '' '' trying t because it `` '' '' '' is a a romantic need t him and and som it 's 's not in the the slightest like they they ’ ’ re in a a different when they they ’ ’ re right in while playing it and can ’ ’ t it ’ ’ s s a to get back t where you you wer where you you ar supposed t to op after th on its and i i could could se of it even though though i i was that i need t to find find th the gam game is the charact is a a romantic off as nothing but but  if you you ar are  a fan fan of ’ s and its sequel t this gam game is is not if you arcadia bay it do it can what th of thos the ending,negative

spoil for doubl exposur and som ones for lis and i really want to lik this gam but her is my review as fan of lif is strang sinc trying to do lis plot with the storm and stuff but fail to lis just for the impact becaus ther is emotional impact in doubl exposur as if trying to profit on your emotional for the first gam and it 's not even the gam almost everyon is eith boring or had lik scen and for what alderm as quickly as and even that was n't explain or both also deck nin reduc the characters to lik and they can be in one in short deck nin is the characters for exampl mos is the `` '' '' '' and that 's basically his whol charact and the story around this so let 's say we need to damag but only in way certain someon can it then you hav the moment of mos is sort of mechanic so you go to him anoth exampl is amand avengers type mor and mor characters suddenly had powers and safi start to collect the peopl lik in lis the story is about rachel and eventually trying to stop yes that 's to the pow but mor of an after effect whil max and chlo is up and also the thing with and so much mor in lis it 's about two trying to to after the the mom and on your and your with and ultimately on the so 's pow is not the main focus eith it 's mor lik something to or we will get in etc the pric is for just the edition so i am not paying twic as much for two scen of random cat and an lik i in fact do n't want to look lik or as my even the normal outfits wer really weird especially the color wer horribl terribl and i hav to flirt with obvious just becaus you could kiss chlo and in lis and kiss and in lis does n't mean it 's major thing but her it felt forc even though i do n't car at all not to mention both of them are not very likeabl it also had nothing to do with the plot just som i and with cring dialog options even deck nin out her charact in befor the storm just to mak them break up off scre and chang the lis max and chlo pictur they mak it look terribl and the reason for the break up is so that max could hav romanc with characters in this gam which deck nin mad big deal in do n't nod said they want to creat relat characters going through struggl but of supernatural twist howev her it was all about powers powers and powers whil speaking in lis she constantly puts her hand on her sometim she 's and she does n't that etc but in she is jok and then about it all thes scen are incredibly cring and i want to die every tim i was forc to list to that not to mention that the whol pricefield break up in the original gam chlo immediately max back after and choosing everything against her chlo with etc she nev leav max throughout the gam so all in all it 's just terribl writing chlo would not in fact leav max half and start flirting with victori out of all peopl the diary was terribl the moment of max writing `` '' she left '' '' and all around it and on anoth pag ther is max in style with both amand and vinh each her on whil max in her is also not only is max but also an do n't get wrong i actually lik som parts of it but it did n't giv the sam feeling lik in lis and even bts wer sup random and then the thing wher max can just tak phot of peopl or things and it on som kind of for everyon to see even wher she should n't hav been i think plot hol her it felt lik in lis and i lov it and even went back as to collect them for achievements and almost every choic was lik if i on or not literally and som wer about lis if you sacrific chlo or arcadi bay lik it should n't hav been major choic was the chapt they could just ask befor i start the gam lik in lis all in all it to the sam `` '' ending '' '' and it was n't i was really confus and the whol marvel thing was sup cring the cherry on top was text at the end `` '' max caulfield will return '' '' ple deck nin stop gam and characters that do n't to you just becaus you are for money and want to fans of the seri edit i forgot to mention max eith had let whol city got but storm from of her powers or goes into the past to the moment she first used them in order not to let the storm form at all and her best friend chlo get shot but she used her new powers again this is i had bought doubl exposur as fan of the seri and i expect an okay gam but it was even wors than i thought ther are many mor things that i could point out but i 'm out of spac so i 'll just with what i did n't lik the most and so much mor to talk about honestly you should n't consid doubl exposur as canon becaus it 's basically the original creators are do n't nod not deck nin this gam is not enjoy and not worth the money atrocious story writing and an even wors ending double exposur and som lis and and i i really really want wanted t to lik like this this gam game but but her is my as a a fan fan of of lif life is is strang trying t to d with th the storm storm and to lis just for for th there is is no double exposur exposure  as if trying t on your for th the first first gam game and and it it 's 's not not ev everyone is and for for what as he and ev even that that w was n't n't explain deck nin to lik and they they c can b in on in short deck nin for exampl moses is is the the `` `` '' '' '' '' and and that that 's 's basically character and and the the story let 's need t in a a way then you you hav have th moment of moses is is a sort of and mor powers and and safi the peopl in lis the story story is and eventually trying t that 's to th the pow more of while max max and and chlo chloe is up and also th the thing so much much mor in lis it 's trying t on your and ultimately on the is not not th the main it 's more lik the pric price is just th no i i am am not of a and an no i in fact do n't n't want want t like  even th especially th and i i hav have t to flirt flirt with just becaus because you you could chloe and in lis lis and in lis does n't it 's 's a a major but her here it it felt even though though i i do do n't n't car at all not t to mention both of of them them ar are not it als also h nothing t to d with th the plot deck nin her charact character in in befor before th the storm just t to mak break up and chang change th the lis max and and chlo make it the reason reason for for th break up is so that max could hav characters in in this this gam game which deck nin made  a big big deal in de do n't n't nod said they they want want t to creat going through of a here it it was was all all about powers and in lis on her she 's and she does n't but in in de she is is a and then about it it all and i i want wanted t to di time i i was forced t listen t that not not t to mention that th the whol break up up in in the the original original gam max back she nev throughout th the gam game s all in in all all it it 's 's just chloe would would not not in in fact with victori out of of all moment of of max `` '' '' she left m '' '' '' and it and there is is max max in while max max h is als not only is max do n't n't get get m me wrong some parts parts of of it it but but it it did did n't me th the sam feeling lik like in in lis lis and and ev and then then th where max max c take  a phot of peopl it on on som some kind kind of to se where sh should n't n't hav have b i think plot hol here it it felt felt lik like  in lis lis and and i i lov it and and ev back  like if if i on a or not and som if you arcadia bay like it it should should n't n't hav have b been  a major was th they could before i the gam game lik like in in lis all in in all all it to th the sam `` '' '' ending '' '' '' and and it it was was n't i was was really and the the whol the cherry cherry on on top was  a text at the the end `` '' '' max max caulfield caulfield will will return return '' '' '' deck nin games and and characters characters that that d do n't to you you just just becaus because you you ar want t fans of of the the seri to mention a whol but  a storm of her her powers into th the past to th the moment them in not t let th the storm at all all and her best best friend her new new powers again this this is i had double exposur exposure  as a fan of of the the seri series and and i i expect game but but it it was even wors than i i thought there ar things that that i i could but i i 'm out of so i i 'll with what what i i did did n't n't lik like th the most so much much mor you should should n't double exposur exposure  because it it 's 's basically the original original creators do n't n't nod deck nin this gam game is is not and not not worth worth th the money writing and and an even wors,negative
lif is strang doubl i start playing this gam with strong feeling that i would probably end up it howev for the first few hours i was i thought `` '' mayb this gam wo n't be so bad '' '' and it was nic to be wrong but that feeling only for the first few hours and then the `` '' story '' '' happen lif is strang doubl exposur lif is strang doubl exposur i want to say that and this is n't just about lif is strang but many works that lat becom if you creat decent story and it 's complet then in most cas the creators hav nothing mor to say it ’ s usually bett to start something new than to mak sequel obviously sequels are mad for if something enough money and they often creat an entirely different story or gam and on the nam to help it sell again but in most cas this isn ’ t it mak things wors and it peopl away i feel lik ther hav been too many cas lik this to the but in the peopl in are often not content creators they look at past and say `` '' mor '' '' well in the cas of lif is strang it feels lik the story was by thos very in with the it ’ s the sam old thing and including the characters the gam looks beautiful and the first coupl of hours befor the `` '' story '' '' in offer that sam lif is strang vib that i personally enjoy about the first part it feels lik if you the and the plot leaving players just to and in the gam might be bett as for optimization it ’ s hard for to i saw of reviews mentioning that the gam is buggy i did n't experienc that but i also didn ’ t hav even though the developers that to the with lif is strang should ’ ve been just the first part mayb with befor the storm and possibl years down the lin inste we hav whol seri of stori i hop peopl with the and the that this to doesn ’ t pay off life is is strang strange doubl playing this this gam game with with  a strong that i i would end up for th the first first few few hours hours i i was i thought `` '' this gam wo n't n't be so b '' '' '' and and it it was to b but that for th the first first few few hours hours and and then then th the `` `` '' '' story story '' '' '' life is is strang strange doubl double exposur de lif life is is strang strange doubl double exposur i want want t to say say that and this this is is n't life is is strang strange but if you create  a decent story and and it it 's then in the creators nothing mor to say it ’ ’ s something new to mak make  a sequel an entirely entirely different game and on the but in isn ’ ’ t it mak and it i feel feel lik have b like this the peopl are oft say `` `` '' '' '' in the case of of lif life is is strang it feels feels lik like th the story story w it ’ ’ s s the the sam the characters characters th the gam game looks and the the first couple of before th `` '' '' story story '' '' '' life is is strang that i about th the first it feels feels lik like if if you and the the plot just t the gam might b be bett it ’ ’ s s hard for m me t i saw that th the gam game is i did did n't but i didn ’ ’ t t hav even though the developers to th life is is strang should ’ ’ ve ve b just th the first before th the storm storm and and a down th we hav have  a whol series of i hop and the that this doesn ’ ’ t,negative
this review will spoilers for doubl exposur feel fre to skip to the end for the final if you want to avo spoilers lif is strang doubl exposur is as the first direct sequel in this seri of after the first gam endings the developers mad the choic of setting up futur stori as that only touch on what happen sinc the first gam becaus of the premis deck nin for it is imposs to this gam without spoilers the very first lif is strang awkward girl max caulfield as she the social realiti of high she away from her of arcadi bay at young age only returning at the age of to it 's whil ther she with her friend chlo pric and also discovers she the ability to rewind tim of the futur tells her that massiv storm is coming to the town and whil whol trying to disast max and chlo solv murd mystery and the of the at the end max must decid wheth to use her tim travel powers one last tim to prevent the disast for good by allowing chlo to die the entir 's past event or to sav her best friend one last tim and let the storm tak its cours upon finishing every lis gam it will giv you full of choic and the final choic of lis to by fans as `` '' bay bae '' '' is right down the keep this in mind that if any wer to happ to lis that any will end up of the peopl who play the gam and who are your potential biggest lik other lis sequels is about you at the beginning which choic you mad at the end of lis as it is direct sequel set years lat you can choos wheth or not you decid to sav arcadi bay as well as wheth max and chlo friends or becam romantic to the in the room matt if you chos friendship or romanc max and chlo are in an entir gam that feels lik badly writt fan fiction how the relationship feels the most lik bad fan fiction if they wer chlo breakup to max she 's fre that ca n't be tied down direct of her previous if they wer friends max and chlo go from being to literally each other and max herself to chlo 's other clos friend rachel this all serv to mak max herself feel lik she n't day she 's supp to be years old now but is still awkward and to in social though she will mak very flirty and horny comments of the play 's control weirdly enough if the marketing itself did n't say that decad had you 'd hardly know besid max having as charact to herself at the start of lis ther are or mentions of of tim in the gam itself that was present in previous lis gam i 'd almost suggest that the reason for this is becaus they had n't out when exactly this gam was supp to tak plac as they wer writing it and just left it open until it was too to go back and chang anything it the then if felt the need to the why even bring max back the obvious reason is becaus it 's great marketing and i would n't be the only sup fan who got in by this i could almost it if the gam 's writing and story felt at all but for something that liv and dies by this it is easily the biggest fault with the premis is that max having been so by what happen at the end of lis spent the past decad on the mov and now down at caledon to from her past is out of her lif now and she not used her tim rewind powers sinc lis whil out with her new friends mos and safi one she safi get upon anoth event max discovers her powers hav again this tim in new form now max can shift betw different timelin to one wher her new best friend safi is aliv max 's becom to use this new ability to the in the timelin and sav 's lif it 's genuinely intriguing premis but also total it 's thes early parts of murd that will mak you why max is even her ther 's nothing really uniqu to her charact that `` '' max need to be the protagonist of this story '' '' and the gam itself does such poor job of the betw max mos and safi that you just kind of hav to tak it on its fac that thes thre are rid or die friends for lif for the story to work at all of cours all is not what it seems and eventually the story becom complet of lis and that is when you see why they mad max the main charact wher episod of this gam its tim lis 's ending and episod will mak you why this gam even episod through are basically bad fan fiction of lis with episod making multipl direct spoil referenc to lis 's ending it 's truly baffling then that the marketing had the to say this gam was the perfect entry for new players to the seri for seri that well as an of mostly stori then ends with sup of other peopl with powers that mak if this is from squar enix so if the writing sucks is ther anything about this gam the gameplay itself is nothing to writ about gameplay was nev the strong of lis but her it feels even becaus it 's basically imposs to usually you will need go from one timelin to anoth to an or talk to specific characters and ther will always be tim the gam itself at least looks very good if you hav enough to run it and once again the motion captur that tru colors had the music is your fair by now you will hav decid if you lik or hat it the performanc are pretty good hannah tell and it out of the as max and most of the other are doing the best to sell the really awful writing in the end it 's really hard to justify paying full pric for gam clearly writt by developers who eith do n't car any mor or nev did and just feels lik you 're playing someon 's bad fan fiction are mad wors by the absolutely terribl for your money dlc you only very get to play with your pet cat in episod and i do n't know if it was bug but not every dlc is avail at all tim throughout the story it is actually really funny that they did the early access that the biggest fans who would be most disappoint would get to experienc the disappointment up double exposur to th the end for th the final if you you want want t to av life is is strang strange doubl double exposur exposure is as the the first in this this seri series of after th the first first gam the developers made th choice of what happen since th the first first gam game becaus because of of the deck nin nine h it is this gam the very first lif life is is strang max caulfield she h away from from h of arcadi arcadia bay at the it 's with h chloe pric she h has th ability t rewind tim of the the futur that  a massiv storm is the town a whol trying t max and and chlo a murd murder mystery of the at the the end to us time t to prevent to di the entir to sav save h her best best friend time and and let let th the storm lis gam game it it will give you a full choices and and the the final final choic choice of of lis `` '' '' '' down th that if to happ to lis end up of the the peopl people wh played th the gam game and de is at the the beginning at the the end end of of lis as it it is is a you c or not decided t to sav arcadia bay as well well  max and and chlo in the no matt matter if if you you chos max and and chlo in an entire gam game that that feels feels lik badly writt fan fiction how th the most bad f fan fiction if they they wer to max she 's 's a ca n't n't be of her if they they wer max and and chlo from being each oth and max to chlo chloe 's to mak max herself feel lik she h she 's supposed t to b is still awkward and will mak of the the play if the the marketing did n't say that that  a decad as a a charact at the of lis there ar are n of tim in the the gam game itself that w lis gam games i i 'd that th the reason reason for for this this is because they they h had n't this gam game w supposed t to tak as they they wer writing it it and and just just left until it it was to g go back back and and chang felt th need t max back because it it 's 's great and i i would would n't n't be be th the only by this i could if the the gam game 's writing and and story at all for something something that by this it is the biggest is that that max what happen at the the end end of of lis the past on the and has at caledon from h her past out of of her now and and she she h with h her new moses and and safi her powers again this this tim in a a new max c timelines t her new new best best friend safi is is aliv max 's to us ability t in the it 's 's a a total it 's parts of that will will mak make you why max max is is ev there 's to h her charact `` '' '' max to b be th of this this story story '' '' '' '' and and the the gam game itself such  moses and and safi that you you just kind of have t to tak it on on its its fac for lif for th the story at all all of of cours is not it seems and eventually the story a complet of lis lis and and that that is when you why they they mad max th the main main charact of this this gam ending and will mak make you this gam a bad bad f fan fiction of lis lis with references t to lis ending it it 's that th the marketing to say say this this gam game w was th to th the seri for  well  as an if this this is is a square enix so if if the the writing is ther about this this gam game th the gameplay nothing t to writ was nev of lis but her here it it feels because it it 's 's basically you will from on to anoth characters and and ther will always always b be  the gam game itself at least very good if you you hav have  it and true colors the music music is you will will hav if you it the are pretty pretty good good hannah hannah tell it out out of of the as max max and most of of the the oth in the the end it 's 's really hard t to justify for  a gam do n't n't car and just just feels feels lik like you you 'r bad f fan fiction by the your money you only get t to play with your episode and and i i do do n't n't know know if if it it was was  but not at all throughout th the story it is that they they d early access that th the biggest fans wh would b get t to experienc,negative

i really want to lik this gam lif is strang tru colors the previous deck nin gam in the seri was one i deeply enjoy i gav them the of the doubt when it was they wer bringing max back even though an entirely new doing sequel to belov gam odd choic whil the gam mak decent starting one can handl the way the gam the chlo choic it quickly becom that this is not story about max caulfield the first thre chapters do decent job of mystery using the new twist on the powers and even having charact even if the limit are really mak the whol thing feel lik low sequel to but the final two chapters the narrativ that it really the experienc the gam does n't really explor the timelin mechanic beyond two or thre light puzzl that are just becaus you can only use the mechanic at specific the fact that ther are two timelin does n't provid any interesting chang or other than one timelin blu color and mor music and the other one color and mor music which is for about minut the thing is i could lot of the with the gam and its of the sam are its run tim if the narrativ was worth it or had anything new or interesting to say about max or any of the characters i know i keep mentioning it but it can not be how much the narrativ the gam fast than the lin at the end of the mor as now than promis the original music is nic but the are visually it looks fin ther 's to the atmospher thanks to the setting but even so ther 's only so many tim you can through the sam thre and befor you find yourself along to the next plot point the cast for the most part are the only real is mos and the only interesting presenc is with almost as quickly as is introduc which mak the entir gam kind of hav zer stak max is so far from the cast and the that the of the dark respons mor of than shock when ther are real charact dram or tension betw anyon what is ther to get in i really want to lov this gam but if deck nin wants to keep making gam with max as the do n't know that i want them to the first thre chapters are worth but after 're bett off just reading max caulfield fan fiction at least thos writers understand why peopl lov the charact oh and the dlc absolutely off i really really want wanted t to lik like this this gam life is is strang true colors the previous deck nin game in in the the seri one i them th of the when it it was they wer max back even though an entirely a sequel sequel t to  the gam a decent the way way th the gam the chlo that this this is is not not  a story about max max caulfield the first first thre three chapters a decent a mystery the new on the the powers powers and and ev even if if the make th the whol whole thing feel lik like  sequel t to  but th the final two chapters the narrativ that it it really the experienc the gam game d does n't n't really just becaus because you you c the fact fact that that ther there ar two timelin does n't other th and mor and the the oth and mor which is the thing i could a lot lot of of the with th the gam game and and its of the the sam if the the narrativ worth it to say about max any of of the the characters characters i i know it but but it it can can not not b how much the narrativ the gam faster th at the the end end of of the as a the original music is but th it looks there 's 's a to th thanks t to th but ev there 's 's only so many many tim you c through th the sam to th the next the cast for th the most the only moses and and the the only as he the entir entire gam kind of max is is so so f from th the cast cast and and the that th of the more of there ar are n no real what is is ther to get i really really want wanted t love this this gam game but but if deck nin wants t to keep with max as the do n't n't know know that that i i want the first first thre three chapters chapters ar but aft max caulfield fan fiction at least understand why loved th the charact and the,negative
oh wher do i even the gam nic ide too bad it execut them so poorly the lack of really the gam down you get to see the caledon the and the snapping it som of the early lin betw characters are sup cringy for exampl the one safi says not long after the gam start `` '' see this is why you need and in cas you break your ass and need an ass '' '' which grown up would say that to someon they ’ ve known for only few vinh 's whol charact is weird an sexual the only cool charact in this gam is gwen ther are som very big in the gam the first one is the second the third the fourth well sinc the gam is set up for sequel we can only hop the next will explain the mention but lis doubl in itself is weird mediocr gam to say i ’ m very dissapoint this been the worst lis gam in the letdown the gam game h bad it so poorly the lack lack of the gam you get get t to se see th and the some of of the characters ar for exampl the on after th the gam `` '' this is you n you break '' '' grown up say that they ’ ’ ve only a a few character is the only character in in this this gam game is there ar in the the gam game th the first first on one is is the the second the third the fourth since th the gam game is set up up for for  a sequel we c hope th the next is a game  to say say i i ’ ’ m this h has b the worst lis gam game in in the,negative
nev thought i 'd down lis gam yet her we are chapters wer pretty enjoy last two wer pretty awful it felt rush questions went and the ending was just horribl other than that the romanc choic wer okay at best ther was n't much to them ther was so much sexual and that it got bit the sid characters wer mostly pretty boring and bland and it felt we did n't get to know them that well becaus of the timelin and really just lack of with them was so reggi and diamond felt lik characters amand was all right but i did n't even lik her that much but most choic do n't matt this was very lin experienc for choic bas gam and even your choic do n't do anything choosing what to from being it will hav consequenc to get into mor things the journal was pretty bad compar to the first gam the pow got boring at tim and was pretty used once mayb few visual bugs diamond starting talking without her mouth lol chapt was incredibly short and ther was n't many are to explor at all the sam few environments are used over and over i 'd a lis lis gam here w chapters wer were pretty last tw were pretty it felt felt rush and the the ending ending w was just other th that th the romanc at best there w was n't much t to them there w was s so much that it got  a bit the sid side characters characters wer bland and and it it felt did n't n't get get t to know know them because of of the lack of with them was s felt lik was all but i i did did n't n't ev like h choices d do n't n't matt this w was  a very for  a choic game and and ev choices d do n't from being it will will hav have consequenc to get things th pretty b compared t to th the first first gam game th the pow got  at tim a few short and and ther there w was n't to explor at all all the the sam over and and ov,negative
they said `` '' respect both endings '' '' but you can tell they only really want to giv you one if you chos chlo over arcadi i would n't wast my money just it the of both max and chlo is insan heavy on chlo and it honestly just feels lik shot in the heart for someon who been in lov with thes characters for almost years making you hav break up story lin with chlo just to immediately new lov interest sucks and mak really not want to it really does that they decid to just throw away the story lin that over half the fan bas chos to do especially after what we see in the comics and what we hear about max and chlo in lis i would hav to see option wher you are in som type of long relationship with chlo and she you cut texts throughout the gam but i want to enjoy this gam so bad but feeling lik this relationship i 've put so much tim and story into just being throw out and sucks its mad up for in the lat chapters becaus the plot of this gam is very interesting and i lov max to death they s `` '' respect both both endings '' '' '' but but you you c really want wanted t to giv give you if you you chos i would would n't max and and chlo chloe is chloe and and it just feels feels lik like  in the someone wh who h has b with thes you hav have  break up with chlo just t a new new lov love interest want t it really that they decided t to just throw away the story chose t to d what w we se in the the comics comics and and what what w about max max and and chlo chloe in in lis lis i i would would hav to se see  where you you ar in som relationship with with chlo chloe and and she throughout th the gam game but i want want t to enjoy this gam game s so b feeling lik like this i 've so much time and and story made up up for in the because th the plot of this this gam game is is very and i i lov max t,negative

even if we set asid all the issu with up with chlo for max may hav sinc the breakup but for the players it would only be minut they 're you to throw away relationship in the first minut of the gam that alon is serious issu from gameplay and play experienc but it end ther perfect `` '' respect the endings '' '' right ther even if all the the issu issues with up with with chlo chloe for for max since th for th it would they 'r you t to throw throw away in the the first first minut minutes of of the the gam game that is a from  but it `` '' respect th the endings '' '',negative
my earli review now that the full rel is her the first two chapters hav the issu but in general they do good enough job to set up the mystery and the characters you will be with throughout the gam then everything falls apart in chapters and and is an absolut disast that only serv to teas the sequel that 's right the story is n't resolv in this one after it out for hours they just literally say `` '' max caulfield will return '' '' the second it 's tim for any consequenc speaking of consequenc your actions do not really hav them the entir story is incredibly to the point wher you can mak every wrong choic and still end up with the sam ending as person who mad every right one the original lis also had simil problem with the ending being rath but at least it for som actions to hav consequenc episod not so much her her you are put on and you ca n't from mr bon wild rid until the gam rath ends i 'd lik to say that at least the characters mak the story worth it but that would be lie everyon is extremely you hav lov interest lov interest an on the and of cours max 's new best friend around the entir do n't get wrong they hav potential and could be furth but mr bon wild rid again and every decision you mak regarding them does n't matt becaus we need to hit thos plot as they com off littl bit i literally when the charact friendship with max been ten minut ago decid to hav to provid som need and then the person who the friendship by to deliv som plot becaus she felt lik it and do n't even get start on safi who might as well be considering how often she betw two completely different overall the charact work is massiv even compar to tru colours not to mention the original the gameplay is mostly just frustrating even with the hints turn completely off max will still provid `` '' '' '' on how to solv the puzzl the second you encount them and the puzzl are pretty bad mostly to `` '' get an of information in the other timelin use it in the current timelin to progress '' '' and the few tim decknin to step up the gam are equally and straight from thos frustrating early s wher the only way to progress is to with everything in every singl way until the random sequenc of events works for exampl to you need specific the you saw in the previous room wo n't do the gam will tell you to find of in certain room although max ide that it should be her turns out what the gam wants from you is to pictur down to reveal key although non of this is in any way the moment of the gam is the ending of episod wher max betw two timelin to person who is looking for her it is an extremely lam tak on in the and once again incredibly with only one correct way to resolv the situation you ca n't even the encount becaus the mr bon wild rid do n't stop max just suddenly gets her old powers back for moment then them again until the plot requir for her to get them back let 's talk about things that work the charact are charming even if not all of them are in the sam style tell does n't miss bit as max and both her and voic performanc are and deserv much bett writing than whatev she was giv mos despit being of an is charming and funny to the point i wish was the protagonist or at least charact sometim and the music is great as always with `` '' '' '' being my favourit in the gam it 's just that all thos awesom parts only to the poor story work and boring gameplay regarding the gam 's technical stat at least on the patch of the actual rel quit few visual glitch especially with doors you also hav that do n't sometim and you the chapt it 's mostly limit to but still the experienc is n't for exampl giving the card to in chapt may not be possibl at all unless is on your sid and the dialog actually you also do n't hav or any other form of so the gam looks eith on low settings or and blurry on high considering that this is titl with and even the settings at the of my i get into s during heavy scen having som decent would help lot ps chlo pric does not in this gam of short nightmar sequenc and som if you are going in expecting pricefield in any do not even if you choos the bae timelin in the the will be up by the tim of the actual story in the gam the is but on som level i understand chlo 's would mor work and betw and mr bon wild rid do n't stop for thos for the other of lis are equally gon even if you choos the bay timelin you wo n't get any on etc that th the full full rel the first first tw two chapters issues but but in in general they d to set set up up the the mystery and the the characters you will will b throughout th the gam chapters and and is is an the sequel that 's the story story is is n't in this this on it out out for they just say `` `` '' '' max max caulfield caulfield will will return return '' '' '' '' the the second it 's time for speaking of do not not really them th the entir story is to th the point point wher where you you c and still end up up with with th the sam as a a person person wh one th the original original lis also h had  with th the ending but at at least for som to hav have consequenc so much you ar and you you c ca n't mr bon bones wild wild rid until th the gam i 'd like t to say say that at least the characters make th worth it it but but that that would would b be  everyone is you hav have  love interest love interest on the and of of cours max 's 's new new best best friend the entir do n't n't get get m me wrong they hav could b mr bon bones wild wild rid again and you mak does n't n't matt need t as a a littl when th the charact with max max h has b decided t to hav have  and then then th person wh felt lik like it it and do n't n't ev even get get m might  as well between tw completely different the charact is a a massiv compared t true colours not t to mention mention th the original the gameplay with th `` '' '' '' how t to solv solve th the puzzl the second them and and the the puzzl are pretty pretty b `` '' in the the oth use it it in in the '' '' '' and and the the few where th the only only way way t is to everything in in every every singl until th for exampl you n in the the previous wo n't the gam game will tell you you t to find in a max h has n no ide that it it should what th the gam is to none of of this this is in any any way way th moment of of the the gam game is is the the ending ending of where max between tw two timelin timelines t a person person wh for h it is is an on a in the way t you c ca n't n't ev because th mr bon bones wild wild rid do n't for  a moment until th the plot for h to get let 's things that the charact even if all of of them them ar in the the sam does n't a bit as max max and she w despite being being  to th the point point i i wish was th at least and the the music music is is great `` '' '' '' in the the gam game it it 's 's just that all the gam game 's at least on the of the quite  a few that d do n't it 's still th the experienc is n't for exampl in chapt not b at all on your and the do n't n't hav the gam game looks considering that that this this is is a and ev even th of my i get a lot chloe pric does not in this this gam of a nightmare sequenc and som if you you ar in any do not not ev even if if you you choos choose th the ba in the will b by the the tim of the in the the gam game th on som chloe 's mr bon bones wild wild rid do n't for thos for th of lis even if if you you choos choose th the bay you w wo n't n't get,negative
this is one of the gam i 've ever play it feels as if it 's complet max is in this gam for absolutely reason other than on or whatev safi is frustrating and deeply in way i 'm not entirely sur was and the one interesting charact from the gam in nev to be seen again caufield will return at the end of the gam but quit honestly i hop she nev does i hop this gam is entirely forgott and so poorly they nev of bringing her back again this is one of of the games i i 've 've ev ever play it feels as if if it it 's 's a a complet max is in this this gam game for no reason other th safi is in a a way way i i 'm 'm not and the the on from th the gam to b caufield will will return at the the end end of of the the gam game but i hop she nev i hop hope this this gam game is so poorly,negative
can not recommend gam looks sup blurry way to fix that updat setting to that ther 's scre too does n't help it eith gam gets sup when using powers too doubt thanks to denuv are often edit they 're just tied togeth not many of the dlc outfits are missing from the and it 's to hair color if using one lik hair ther 's way to skip so if you hav to from checkpoint expect getting back to wher you wer and it may hav been quit ways back immediately upon starting the gam you hav to choos if chlo up with you or is dead yeah even the original for lif is strang they 'd nev hav don that next you hav to immediately decid if you hav on som new charact of if they are n't your type after lik from them with context immediately after being hit with the chlo stuff lik are you serious and the way they mad chlo act in old texts you can read then having her flirting with victori on social medi that was literally in the nightmar sequenc of the original lif is strang it was so bad this was charact assassination ther 's other way around it they absolutely the franchis from they did n't understand why lis was and obviously did n't lik it it 's very clearly writing of the highest order but even if they did n't charact max chlo in the worst way possibl and the was an entirely new charact it still would n't be good gam due to the lazy way are present i 'll avo max 's powers in this gam but unlik the original they 're lam and annoying now ther 's also zer to be doing any of it they ruin everything good about lif is strang the mystery is kind of cool but it seems they that having mystery to solv was the only reason lis was updat i 've finish the gam now all of the wer tru it 's by far the worst gam in the entir franchis do not buy avo this gam lik the god it 's so bad i did n't enjoy any of it but i 'll try to be fair let 's see i enjoy the voic acting hannah tell did great job as always it was nostalgic her the rol but this was n't remotely max caulfield i do n't know who this was they had her fac and her voic but it was n't her this max was n't awkward and did n't act remotely lik the original max is littl which i guess is nic the good pretty much ends ther the romanc options wer the one present immediately after the chlo decision seems okay as person but is n't interesting in the slightest and ther 's tim giv to even get to know her befor trying to mak som kind of decision on her she 's not really and lik young total normal then weird over it then lik really the girl literally zer sens of and we 're just supp to believ everyon she 's and cool becaus they just tell us she is lik she 's not the other is total neith max chlo would hav ever even one even in real lif would go for someon lik that the story was so bad it had literally non of the of the original total charact assassination with zer respect even pacing bad romanc bad gameplay bad pow lam and the original miss lot of the choic are so not obvious and out of the way lik one just requir to thes peopl talking for such long tim one would do it the ending was sup bad it was so bad i honestly could n't ever anoth lif is strang in deck nin 's you got hard on this one can not not recommend game looks way t that ther there 's does n't powers to thanks t are oft they 'r 're just of the the dlc outfits ar from th and it it 's there 's 's no way t so if if you you hav have t from  back t where you you wer and it have b quite  the gam game you you hav have t to choos up with even th the original for lif life is is strang you hav have t if you you hav have  on som if they they ar are n't with n with th the chlo chloe stuff are you and the the way they mad you c with victori social medi that w in the nightmare sequenc of the the original original lif life is is strang it was was s so b this w character assassination there 's 's no the franchis they d did n't n't understand understand why did n't n't lik like it it it it 's of the but ev even if if they they d did n't chloe in in the the worst and the an entirely would n't n't be be  a good good gam due t to th i 'll max 's 's powers in this this gam game but unlike th the original they 'r there 's to b any of of it life is is strang the mystery mystery is kind of but it it seems a mystery to solv was th the only i 've finished th the gam all of of the it 's far th the worst worst gam game in in the the entir do not this gam game lik like th it 's 's so so b bad i i did did n't any of of it it but but i i 'll try to to b let 's i enjoy the voic voice acting hannah tell did  a great great job it was but this this w was n't max caulfield i do do n't n't know this w they h and her but it it was was n't max w was n't awkward and did n't like th the original max is is a a littl which i i guess the romanc romance options the on after th the chlo as a a person is n't in the the slightest and ther there 's 's no even get get t to know trying t to mak some kind kind of on her she 's 's not not really like  over it sense of we 'r 're just supposed t to believ she 's because they they just she is she 's 's not not th the oth is a a total chloe would would hav no on even in in real real lif would g that th the story story w was s so b bad it none of of the of the the original character assassination and the the original a lot lot of of the the choic are s and out out of of the the way one just such  long tim no on would d do it the ending ending w bad it it was was s so b bad i could n't life is is strang deck nin nine 's on this this on,negative
i bought and play this gam on its rel day th i do n't recommend playing this gam though ther 's coupl why the plot is the sam as the first lis gam 's plot your best friend dies and you need to use your pow to sav her by the timelin when she 's sav storm is coming and the small town will be in you hav to choos betw your friend or the town your choic barely matt especially the important decisions that are supp to mak hug in the story spoil it was nev explain why how in chapt alderm the detectiv his other self from the dead world the other self and then into and to one ever about him after that ther 's for why or how this happen in the first plac it was n't explain how or why reggi found at the was this the sam situation that happen to alderm why was this nev mention again you hav to constantly through the last pag if you want to read the diary entry such the random that you can collect are they from different timelin this was n't explain eith this is the second lis gam with max in it she 's so why was ther `` '' phot mod '' '' or something added in the gam this featur was miss opportunity that would 've us to hav that creativ of snapping phot and them in the lis community i 'd hav lov to tak phot of anyon and anything in this gam especially considering that the gam graphics visually looks stunning even phot mod and that gam is n't even about chlo pric is charact and she was handl poorly in this gam you only get to hear her voic and read coupl of her text messag or social medi posts that 's about it her feels than lif max `` '' nightmar sequenc '' '' in chapt should hav been safi 's nightmar sequenc i understand wanting to max traum from the first lis gam but i feel as this was miss bett opportunity for us to what safi been going through her entir lif at caledon befor she met max i 'm saying this becaus we barely could even with safi we had littl to non about her after all the gam denuv in it it 's the main reason why the performanc is absolut you do n't want peopl to your gam i get it but you 're the gam 's performanc but denuv to your so i 'm why the devs chos to over performanc quality som of the achievements are out wo n't up even though you did the correct on getting the achievement for exampl the achievement the cat achievements are lock behind pay meaning you 'd hav to pay for the ultimat edition you wo n't even be able to your achievements this gam is n't that or lik everyon else in the reviews would stat so i do n't know why it was different for but the can the only i 've encounter throughout the entir gam wer gwen going when you first her in the and luc already being open befor i got the key to open it myself the ending will always be the sam matt what choic you 've mad it also feels lik the ending is n't even meant to be an ending rath cliffhang to the next chapt also giv the text that up at the end of the it that part of this gam will com out but this my that this gam is n't even finish the devs could 've giv it mor tim to things up or add mor chapters considering that the plot yet to mov forward i do hav few things that i lik about this gam max caulfield is my favorit charact i 'm glad she 's back i 'm glad hannah tell is as her max pow from tim to this is mor fun and i lik the in contrast and music betw the two we can from the art in the snapping and in max diary i do n't hav to be in romantic relationship with anyon in this gam the graphics are stunning i felt lik i was into the world of the choic of music is amazing it tak back to the original lis gam tldr do n't buy this gam unless it 's on sal wait until `` '' part `` '' of doubl exposur com out this gam on its i do do n't n't recommend playing this this gam there 's 's a a coupl why the the plot is the the sam as the the first first lis lis gam game 's best friend and you you n need t to us power t to sav save h she 's a storm storm is and the will b be in you hav have t to choos the town your choic especially th supposed t to mak make  a hug in the the story it was was nev in chapt from th the d the oth and then no on after that that ther there 's 's no how this this h happened in in the the first first plac it was was n't n't explain at the was this the sam that h happened t why was was this you hav have t through th the last if you you want want t read th such  that you you c from  a different this w was n't n't explain this is is the the second lis gam game with with max max in in it she 's 's a so why why was `` '' photo mod '' '' in the the gam game this was  that would us to to hav them in in the the lis i 'd 'd hav to tak in this this gam considering that that th the gam has  a phot photo mod and that game is is n't n't ev chloe pric price is is a character and and she she w in this this gam game you you only get t a coupl couple of of her text messag social medi that 's about it `` '' '' nightmar nightmare sequenc '' '' in chapt should hav have b safi 's nightmare sequenc wanting t from th the first first lis lis gam game but but i i feel as this this w was  us to has b going through at caledon max i i 'm with safi little t about h all the the gam game h in it it it it 's 's the the main why the the performanc you d do n't n't want game i i get it but but you you 'r the gam game 's to your so i i 'm why the the devs chose t some of of the the achievements achievements ar wo n't even though you d for exampl the cat achievements ar 'd hav have t for th ultimate edition you w wo n't n't ev be abl able t to your this gam game is is n't everyone els in the so i i do do n't n't know it was for m me but but th the only i 've throughout th the entir entire gam game wer when you her in in the before i i got to op the ending will always always b be th the sam no matt matter what choices you you 'v it als feels lik like th the ending ending is is n't n't ev meant t to b be  an ending a cliffhang to th the next given th at the the end end of of the that  a part part of of this this gam game will but this that this this gam game is is n't n't ev finished th the devs time t things up considering that that th the plot to mov i do have  a few things that that i i lik like about about this this gam max caulfield caulfield is is my my favorit i 'm 'm glad she 's i 'm 'm glad hannah tell time t this is fun and and i i lik like th between th the tw we c from th the art in the and in in max i do do n't n't hav have t to b be in in a a romantic relationship with in this this gam game th the graphics graphics ar i felt felt lik like i i was into th the world the choic choice of music is it tak back t

as gam i believ that doubl exposur the potential to be deeply compelling supernatural murd mystery with left behind is imposs for to up ’ s heavily in its concept its cast and the setting it tak plac in max caulfield is charact who i found at the beginning of my own and becaus of this part of feels lik i ’ ve grown up with her returning to her as an and seeing her living her best lif feels lik of and new of hop for my own futur unfortunately for thos who hav play the original gam this is wher thes end is to the lif is strang by nam and nam alon the original gam of lif is strang heavy on the story offer her in very bad way ther is very littl players to the world and the story that had been offer ten years the consequenc of the of arcadi bay or lack is deeply from the get go it ’ s hard to forget the of the original gam and the lack of any real to the original cast sav for comments regarding jefferson and victori only left feeling lik this entir gam had been at what the original had been for despit earli that the gam would both endings of lis with lov and respect it ’ s cle to see that this work was with bay in mind with thos who chos to sav chlo left in the despit being point of the original story and for max ’ s powers if you so choos to keep her is handl in and poor way writt off to mak room for new lov interests that feel and lacking of any real personality all the sam characters lik safi and mos are from the beginning but they ’ re the only characters that feel other characters feel horny and in ther for the sak of simply having them they to mind characters from older gam but lack the depth and that mad them feel and uniqu i found myself quit by and gwen only to find myself and my every tim they cam they too feel lik shallow versions of the with the added of being painfully and towards others despit my earli the story is easily predict and yet massiv amount of plot hol and that simply can not be overall i ’ m left feeling as if this gam as whol is less of sequel to max caulfield ’ s story and mor of rush work with her fac on it for ’ s sak her charact is as good as charact can be after for ten years but even that falls flat with how many miss this gam ther was room to do something new and nostalgic all the sam but it simply feels lik nobody want to put in the lov and that it for thos new to the franchis i do believ that this gam would to them it ’ s to them without making new players hav to replay the gam but in the who hav been following from the very beginning i wouldn ’ t recommend this gam much at all and for thos new looking to experienc romanc i ’ d them to original gam it may be with its and context but it deeply uniqu story that tri to in new way but at for the rest of us ther ’ s always the comics and fanfiction i as a game i believe that double exposur has th to b murder mystery with n for m me t ’ s cast and and the it tak in max max caulfield caulfield is is a a charact i found at the the beginning of my my own because of of this this  a part part of feels lik like i i ’ ’ ve grown up up with with h to h her  as an and seeing her best like  and a a new my own for thos those wh who hav played th the original original gam game this this is de is to th the lif life is is strang the original original gam of lif life is is strang on the the story in a a very there is is very very littl to th the world and the the story story that had b of the of arcadi arcadia bay from th it ’ ’ s s hard hard t of the the original original gam game and and the the lack lack of any real to th the original left m me feeling feeling lik like this entire gam game h had b been  what th the original had b that th the gam game would both endings endings of of lis lis with it ’ ’ s to se that this those wh who chos chose t to sav save chlo in the despite being being  point of of the the original original story story and and a for max max ’ ’ s if you to keep in a to mak new lov love interests any real all the the sam and mos from th the beginning but they they ’ ’ re the only characters that other characters for th characters from games but depth and that mad i found found myself to find feel lik versions of of the with th the story story is and yet has  a massiv amount of plot hol simply c can not not b i ’ ’ m as if if this this gam game  as a a whol of a a sequel sequel t to max max caulfield ’ s s story story and and mor more of of a with h on it it for ’ s her charact character is as good good  as a a charact can b but ev even that with how this gam game h there w to d something new all the the sam but it feels lik wanted t to put in the the lov that it for thos new t to th the franchis franchise i i do believe that that this this gam game would to them them it it ’ ’ s have t to replay the gam game but but in in the who hav have b been following from th the very wouldn ’ ’ t recommend this this gam at all all and and for for thos to experienc i ’ ’ d original gam game it but it story that

honestly this gam lacks in all aspects i hav nev writt review but after finishing doubl exposur i can not recommend anyon buy this ther is very littl content and i finish the gam in about hours graphics and sound are good with small bugs but non too but the story is atrocious the whol chlo pric thing still the story as present mak very littl sens or is not interesting enough to want you to mak sens of it som of the decisions the writers of this gam mad and how thos are present are completely ther are actual characters of lis present in the gam asid from max which is just lost opportunity to mak connection with the play ther are so many littl that mak sens lik why can i tak pictur but only from one or exposur making all pictur the sam anyway so why giv fak taking pictur action that does nothing this gam is short anyway allowing for som self would hav mad up for bit of the other the characters other than mak are okay at best the romanc options are not even options at this point i dont understand if ther is one option and you want your max to be or ther is just option asid from that both vinh and amand are ther is just not enough scre tim for connection to mos and safi are the characters you hav the most tim with and honestly i tell you much about them all other characters are i just dont enough with them i kind lik ther could hav been fun had ther if this gam so short gwen seems `` '' cool '' '' but i lik her i wish i had mor good things to say honestly but even the music is such letdown compar to all other lif is strang in was also bland but now just i lif is strang to and if i hav som but this gam cut it fre dlc for lif is strang this gam mad depress for lif is strang gam honestly this this gam in all i hav but aft double exposur i can can not not recommend buy this there is is very very littl and i finished th the gam game in graphics and are good but th the story story is the whol chloe pric still th the story very littl is not enough t you t to mak make sens sense of of it some of of the the writers of this this gam game mad and how there ar are n of lis in the the gam aside from which is is just just  to mak make  with th the play there ar are s so many no sens sense lik from on the sam so why that d this gam game is for som would hav have mad made up up for for  a bit bit of of the the oth the characters other th at best the romanc romance options options ar are not not ev at this this point point i if ther there is and you you want max t to b there is is just aside from vinh and and amand there is is just just not time for for  connection t moses and and safi the characters you hav have th the most and honestly tell you all oth other characters characters ar i just with them them i could hav have b if this this gam `` '' '' '' '' but but i like h her i i wish wish i i had things t to say but ev even th the music music is such  compared t to all all oth other lif life is is strang life is is strang if i i hav this gam it a for lif life is is strang this gam game mad made m me depress life is is strang strange gam,negative
updat at the spoilers ahe in short do not buy the gam in the stat it is it 's not worth the money i ca n't believ i paid so much money for that sh t why her it is if you thought this gam is going to bring you so much from playing as previous lis gam then you 're wrong as the one who bought this gam in ultimat edition with `` '' cat content '' '' etc i 'm mad and disappoint caus cat mak for only few moments when we 're in max 's that 's all i hat that this gam so many bugs even after full rel it 's `` '' '' '' story from the first gam but with and new characters it the sam the storm simil to thos from arcadi bay `` '' nightmar '' '' episod gam sens most of the tim also characters talk way too much almost action happens even tho the gam is too short if i did n't try to find every i 'd hav finish it even fast than also i hat what they did with chlo from the st gam but about it lat i lik ide of parallel it 's really something new i guess i lik the thing wher we can tak phot as max the charact and the too as long as you hav becaus it can out of the gam many bugs hair going through max 's fac doors crash whil changing realiti if you chang one of the options it 's good but what 's the point to play the gam on the when it looks lik sh t nothing even the look bett then i do n't know if it 's but my max had blu hair for half of the episod wher she was sometim it chang betw scen weird i had an amazing bug wher i only could with max 's head also `` '' we 'll respect both of the endings from the first gam '' '' sur the only ending by the creators is the bay option wher chlo obviously dies if you chos bae option does n't matt if you wer or just you get the most disappointing outcom one expect they chlo as this shallow person who left max becaus `` '' she keeps looking in the past and using powers to rewind and not looking into the futur '' '' she barely can use thos in the gam tho only once actually so even if you chos they wer friends you say `` '' you apart from togeth '' '' lat we chlo hat max becaus her moth got kill in the storm she 'd nev do that as far as we know from the first gam she 'd respect any choic she mak and chlo probably up with victori you know the one who was friends with thes who kill rachel that does n't even mak slightest sens all of thes can be found in max 's journal texts social medi and of cours max 's she even mentions chlo through the whol gam she 's and her as what i can see and still the gam us characters we can hav romantic relationship with at the end chlo texts max if she 's fin becaus of the storm she caus lik they tri to mak stup out of her and now she som heart to text max i hat that they 're going to do som kind of avengers or out of max and and other peopl i mean it looks lik it by the ending that 's the ♥♥♥♥ i ever updat befor rel decknin wo n't mak up for it the plan is to `` '' '' '' the seri and mak it next marvel starting with new characters that 's why they got rid of the old ones this gam is bas on nostalgi from fans of the st gam they knew peopl would com for max and they did this is actually cash grab and i got as well as the others well ther 's new gam from dontnod coming next year `` '' lost records bloom rag '' '' it looks lik it mor lis vib than this at the spoilers ah in short do not buy th the gam game in in the it 's 's not not worth worth th the money i ca ca n't so much for that sh t here it it is if you this gam game is is going going t so much lis gam then you you 'r as the the on this gam game in ultimate edition `` '' cat content '' '' i 'm when w we 'r in max max 's that 's all i i hat hate that that this this gam game h so many full rel it 's 's a `` '' '' '' '' story from th the first first gam game but but with new characters characters it it has has th the sam the storm arcadia bay `` '' '' nightmar '' '' game h has n most of of the the tim way to too much the gam game is too short if i i did did n't try to to find i 'd 'd hav faster th also i i hat what they they d did with with chlo from th game but about it i lik idea of it 's 's really something new i guess i lik like th the thing we c as max max th the charact and the as you you hav because it it can out of of a the gam game h going through max 's if you one of of the it 's what 's 's the the point to play play th the gam on the when it it looks looks lik sh t even th i do do n't n't know know if if it it 's me but of the where sh she w i had where i with max max 's `` '' respect both both of of the the endings from th the first first gam '' '' the only by the the creators is the the bay if you you chos does n't n't matt matter if if you you wer you get the most most disappointing no on chloe  as this person wh max becaus `` '' '' she in the the past and not into th the futur '' '' '' she in the the gam even if if you you chos they wer say `` `` '' '' '' max becaus her moth in the the storm we know from th the first first gam and chlo up with with victori you know the on with thes that d does n't n't ev make  all of of thes can b in max max 's social medi and of of cours max 's through th the whol whole gam she 's her  what i i can can se and still still th the gam we c relationship with at the the end if she she 's because of of the the storm tried t to mak make  out of of her her and and now she h i hat hate that that they they 'r going t to d some kind kind of out of of max max and and oth i me it looks looks lik like it by the the ending ending that that 's 's the wo n't n't mak up for for it is to `` '' '' '' '' the the seri series and make it new characters characters that that 's why they rid of of the this gam game is fans of of the game they they knew for max max and and they they d this is a cash cash grab and i i got as well well  as the the others there 's 's new new

form did not respect bae decision inste of and decision that of players mad the devs just decid that bae was the evil and wrong decision without even thinking about what the original gam was about what max 's charact is really through and why max even would consid the bay i enjoy befor the storm despit som weird decisions behind it i enjoy tru colours howev with this deck nin that they do n't car about the original lif is strang gam its not the so why would they inste they go around the studi talking about what is the least ending and how to peopl who chos the `` '' wrong '' '' ending this will be my last lif is strang gam i 'll ever play or buy dont nod is lost records next year and unlik deck nin dont nod will actually respect your decisions in decision bas gam do bett deck nin good job off of your potential real decision next lis gam will it after all every action consequenc did not not respect instead of made th the devs was th about what what th the original original gam game w about what max 's character is is really and why why max the bay i enjoy before th the storm it i i enjoy true colours with this deck nin nine h that they they d do n't n't car care about about th the original original lif life is is strang strange gam so why the studi about what what is is the the least ending and and how how t people wh who chos the `` `` '' '' '' '' ending will b life is is strang strange gam game i i 'll dont nod lost records deck nin dont nod in a game d deck nin off of of your lis gam game will,negative

finish the gam and i 'm really disappoint i 'll st say if you want this gam then just buy the version the outfits are just versions of the bas outfits and the `` '' cat '' '' they kept talking about at most minut worth of content the gam starts strong with episod both being really good episod and wer decent too but episod was painfully and really bad end to this narrativ the gam also glitch such as not as they should such as an being open when its meant to be lock and doors being out of plac this gam also had wors performanc than all the other lis gam and i had issu of loading in very lot of peopl seem to that this is good gam but not good lif is strang due to its focus on supernatural elements and trying to creat story that will gam whil moving away from elements that mad the lif is strang seri feel special to lot of fans i think it as both but if you do want gam mor focus on the mor supernatural elements of the seri then you might enjoy this on sal finished th the gam game and and i i 'm i 'll if you you want this gam buy th outfits ar are just versions of of the and the the `` `` '' '' '' the gam episode and and a really b end to to this narrative th the gam as they they should as an meant t to b out of of plac this gam also h all the the oth lis gam games and and i i had a lot lot of of peopl seem t that this this is is a a good good gam game but but not not  a good life is is strang due t to its trying t to creat create  story that that will away from that mad made th the lif life is is strang to  a lot lot of i think but if if you you d want  a gam on the elements of of the the seri then you on sal,negative
i think i 'm going through the sam fans felt about the sequel caus what the ♥♥♥♥ i think i 'm going through through th the sam about th the sequel what th the ♥♥♥♥,negative
it ’ s hard to say much without the other chapters so far the gam is enjoy and i lov to see max all grown up but still saying “ ” littl and such she seemingly tru to her charact from the first gam and honestly that ’ s all anyon can ask for when it com to returning charact i saw quit few bugs especially if you go back to your checkpoint the characters bug out lot i guess deck nin really didn ’ t for such even when it ’ s very option and an option in general as well if you use the skip certain parts option it bugs the characters and environment out lot as well which to moment wher max was her hand against something when you had to to essentially mak it which timelin it was in when it com to the romanc options i ’ m not big fan of how minut in or so you ’ re met with amand who you immediately hav to pick if you ’ re going to romanc her or not we hav ide that if you pick her as friend at first if you ’ ll be able to into romanc again once the other chapters are out i ’ d lik to hav known her bit mor in the story befor being giv the choic of having on her especially when it tak max to vinh and in general be flirty with him it feels lik amand is at you mor sinc we ’ ve only heavily seen max with girl befor being chlo it ’ s as if they want you to just she ’ s your only option i don ’ t really lik vinh ’ s charact so far seeing as still is bit flirty with max even when you him again and again “ with your is sexy be sexy max ” yeah i ’ m good ’ s also not really as romanc option unless you at the achievements i hop doesn ’ t just stay this charact the whol way through anoth thing with vinh is that ’ s romanc charact even though ’ s one of the behind safi ’ s murd cas it feels bit off that if it does end up being him even though it is it will be quit to romanc him and get doesn ’ t even mak sens to hav vinh as romanc charact in general when ’ s now the bae or bay ending is something i had ide how deck nin was going to handl i sadly hav to say that it was don very poorly with to the fans to the comics befor the storm and the whol franchis in general how chlo and max break up if you choos the bae ending is something that feels so out of charact for chlo chlo ’ s wer to max in befor the storm saying things about how much she miss max and she nev gav up on her during the first lif is strang gam we see how the two of them hav the and her and ther but they togeth wheth or not i genuinely see them as that even though chlo is to die max is not to let that happ and chlo that in the comics the whol of and everyon else com up and chlo doesn ’ t max in the slightest she says “ i you i couldn ’ t hear her but i could hear you you couldn ’ t hav max ther was right or wrong choic and i ’ m through feeling lik i ’ t of your decision i ’ m sorry if i mad it on you ” as well “ max i ’ m going to to you what you said to so many tim when we first left we don ’ t know we can not know for sur that we caus the storm we know som crazy ♥♥♥♥ happen we know that you ’ t let that crazy ♥♥♥♥ happ again we know that i am her we know that ther was storm that ’ s it you can ’ t it all i can ’ t to believ that our liv can caus on this level the thought now ” with all of this it just feels so wrong that chlo would go back on everything go back on max i feel lik deck nin didn ’ t know what to do with chlo at all so they felt this was the only option if this was all they could think of then mayb new gam with max isn ’ t what we should ’ ve if they want to away from chlo and the bae ending i ’ ll stop now and say i hop the gam past chapt i enjoy the small bit of cat content we got in chapt and i ’ m looking forward to seeing mor of my cat for now i ’ ll hav to giv doubl exposur negativ until we see mor this gam potential for crazy story i just hop deck nin doesn ’ t mess it up mor it ’ ’ s s hard hard t to say the oth so f far th the gam game is and i i lov to se see max grown up to h her charact from th the first first gam game and and honestly that ’ ’ s when it to  i saw quite  a few if you go back back t to your the characters out  a lot i guess deck nin didn ’ ’ t even wh when it it ’ ’ s s a a very and an an option in general as well if you the characters characters and out  a lot as well to  a moment where max max w when you you h had t make it it was was in when it to th the romanc romance options i ’ ’ m not  a big fan of you ’ ’ re have t if you you ’ ’ re going t to romanc or not we hav have n no ide that if if you her  as a a friend at first if you you ’ ’ ll be abl able t the oth chapters ar i ’ ’ d like t to hav a bit in the the story given th the choic choice of on her when it it tak vinh and and in in general it feels feels lik we ’ ’ ve with  it ’ ’ s as if if they they want you t to just she ’ ’ s i don don ’ ’ t t really really lik ’ s so f as he is a a bit with max even wh when you again and with your no i i ’ ’ m he ’ ’ s s als not really as a a romanc unless you at the the achievements i hop doesn ’ ’ t character th the whol is that he ’ ’ s s a a romanc even though he ’ ’ s one of of the safi ’ ’ s it feels a bit that if if it it do end up even though it is it will will b quite  to romanc him and doesn ’ ’ t t ev make sens to hav as a a romanc character in in general he ’ ’ s s a the ba bay ending ending is is something something i i had had n no ide deck nin was going going t to handl have t to say say that that it it was with n to th the fans to th the comics before th the storm storm and and the the whol in general chloe and and max break up if you you choos choose th the ba bae ending ending is is something something that that feels feels s so out out of of charact character for for chlo chloe ’ ’ s to max max in in befor before th the storm things about how much max and she nev up on on her the first first lif life is is strang strange gam we se see how how th the tw two of of them and ther or not see them that ev even though chloe is to di max is is not and chlo in the the comics the whol and everyon everyone els up and and chlo doesn ’ ’ t max in in the the slightest couldn ’ ’ t but i i could couldn ’ ’ t t hav there w was n and i i ’ ’ m feeling lik like i ’ t of your i ’ ’ m if i i mad made it as well “ max max i i ’ ’ m going t to you what you to m so many many tim when w don ’ ’ t we c can not that w the storm we know we know know that that you ’ t we know know that that i i am here w we know know that that ther there w was  a storm that ’ ’ s you c can ’ ’ t it all all i i can can ’ ’ t to believ believe that on this with all all of of this it just just feels feels s chloe would would g go back go back on max max i i feel feel lik deck nin didn ’ ’ t know what to d with chlo at all so they this w was th the only if this this w was all they could a new new gam game with with max isn ’ ’ t what w should ’ ’ ve if they wanted t away from chloe and and the the ba bae ending ending i i ’ ’ ll now and say i i hop hope th the gam i enjoy bit of cat content we got in chapt chapter and and i i ’ ’ m forward t more of of my i ’ ’ ll have t to giv double exposur we se this gam game h for  story i i just deck nin doesn ’ ’ t,negative

if you are new to lis seri this is still great visual graphics issu with amazing soundtrack but if you cam from lis i you do not purch this gam and sav yourself som money as this is ultimately cring experienc with are mor forc and awkward compar to previous gam peopl still act lik despit being full grown this could be as to som peopl ps gam keeps every hours and i had to cut scen over and over again tim setting can look blurry for som peopl tak som to get spoil asid from the technical issu with the gam i simply can not appreciat the fact max is so out of charact in she turns into som horny flirt with vinh and amand when i chos to them down several tim what 's the point of even giving thes options when max just to act horny and do n't even get start on did not the words when they said they will both endings in lis hug disappointment of then to get this kind of i highly doubt futur episod could sav this writing will ther be twist that all the loos ends and all the out of charact mayb at this point best they can do is damag control but i highly doubt the gam will its i will edit my review once all episod are releas final review not worth the money ther are simply too many plot hol and loos ends in the gam the ide of murd mystery through parallel timelin is sup cool but it was poorly execut `` '' '' '' just to travel back and to information becom charact growth had potential it fail if you you ar new t to lis lis seri this is is still a great issues with but if if you from lis lis i you d do not this gam game and as this this is forced and compared t previous gam despite being this could could b some peopl hours and and i i had had t over and and ov for som some peopl to get get  aside from from th technical issu issues with with th the gam game i simply c can not the fact max is is so so out out of of charact character in in de flirt with vinh and and amand when i chose t what 's 's the the point point of do n't n't ev even get get m did not when they they s said they both endings in lis to get kind of i highly save this be  all the loose ends all the out of of charact at this this point they c but i i highly the gam game will i will episodes ar not worth worth th the money there ar plot hol loose ends in the the gam game th idea of a murd murder mystery but it it was poorly execut `` '' '' '' just t back and no charact,negative
this gam is money grab i play the og lif is strang back in when ther wer only two episod releas and it was in of its them and charact development howev doubl exposur does not feel the characters are and it completely the them and the of `` '' show do n't tell '' '' nothing means anything especially the most important decision in the previous gam if you are her becaus you lov the og gam i highly recommend against playing this this gam game is is a i play played th the og life is is strang there wer two episod and it it was character development double exposur does not the characters characters ar and it and the `` '' do n't '' '' especially th the most in the the previous previous gam game if if you you ar because you loved th the og game i i highly playing this,negative
spoilers you 're telling i spent lik on this trash i want my money back this is the biggest cash grab if i 've ever seen one caufield will return are we in the now really som parts of the gam wer okay in chapters but even that was ruin by the mess of that mad absolutely zer sens the entirely of chapt mad just confus and i felt nothing not even any big decisions lik the other gam all i want was for the gam to be over so i could do something else this just felt lik the biggest f you to the rest of the gam in the seri and i will by the fact that lif is strang is the best i even lik som of the characters in this gam mos vinh but did n't appreciat that even though i pick vinh amand was still being down my and obviously over him regardless of my choic then after chapt the romanc options wer with furth at least in my playthrough just what was the point inste of this they should hav mad something original with new characters lik the other gam max did n't need to com back and especially lik this i feel nothing after playing unlik the emotional i felt after lif is strang and the hours i spent feels lik an absolut wast the only nic thing i hav to say is that the gam look visually nic yet even then ther wer so many visual bugs especially on the loading and my kept changing matt how many tim i set it do n't play this gam if you 're an actual fan of lif is strang and thos stori d you 'r me i i spent on this i want this is is the the biggest cash grab if i i 've 've ev ever s caufield will will return in the some parts parts of of the the gam game wer but ev even that that w by the of that that mad made m and i i felt not ev like th the oth other gam all i i want for th the gam game t to b so i i could this just felt lik like th the biggest you t to th the rest rest of of the the gam in the the seri series and and i i will by the the fact fact that life is is strang strange is is the the best some of of the the characters characters in in this this gam did n't that ev even though though i regardless of of my chapter th the romanc romance options with n at least in my my playthrough what w was th the point instead of of this they should should hav have mad new characters like th the oth other gam did n't n't ne need t to com come back back and like this i feel unlike th the emotional i felt life is is strang and the hours i i spent feels lik the only i hav have t to say is that that th the gam then ther there wer so many on the and my no matt many tim times i do n't play this this gam game if if you you 'r an actual fan of of lif life is is strang,negative
this gam was hug letdown it feels rush and way too short and it ’ s poorly making the experienc even wors the story lack any real emotion and ther was far too much throughout the world design was limit with barely any to explor and the characters wer bland without max this gam would be she ’ s the only part worth mentioning chlo ’ s presenc felt and it ’ s disappointing how the gam treat her and the fans who chos her ending choic didn ’ t feel at all whil chapters wer really enjoy the last two chapters wer mess with odd writing and barely any gameplay left overall major miss this gam game w was  a hug it feels rushed and way to too short short and and it it ’ ’ s making th the experienc even wors the story any real and ther there w too much throughout th the world to explor and the the characters characters wer this gam game would would b be  she ’ ’ s s the the only chloe ’ ’ s and it it ’ ’ s how th the gam her and and the the fans fans wh who chos didn ’ ’ t at all chapters wer the last last tw two chapters chapters wer writing and a major,negative
if ther is something in betw yes and i would chos that compar to all other lif is strang gam this is point last two chapters are mess rush story and bad ending also i feel ther is not much actual choic also in the whol gam in general romanc is forc for reason it does n't hav to do anything with story it 's just to be ther to be characters hav personality and you ca n't really read them or put yourself into the are poor ther are things and gam is ok but nothing special would i recommend i would say wait sal if you lik the lif is strang gam if ther there is is something no i i would compared t to all all oth other lif life is is strang strange gam this is last tw two chapters chapters ar story and also i i feel there is is not in the the whol whole gam game in in general no reason reason it it do does n't n't hav have t to d with  a story it 's 's just just t to b to b characters hav have n and you you c ca n't n't really them or there ar game is i would a sal sale if if you like th the lif life is is strang strange gam,negative
its so badly to the point that if u dont hav the numb graphics card on the dont even trying unless u want to play with graphics wors than s motion captur ps the top graphics card will only get you around too so good x so badly to th the point that if have th on the want t to play so good,negative
one of the creators of the original lif is strang wrot `` '' from what i read i think we would not hav writt things the sam way but i felt the sam with the comics and befor the storm and i kind of it i ’ m pretty sur when i play the full gam i wo n't recogniz my characters but that ’ s also with different writers '' i do n't recogniz this max caufield i do n't recogniz the chlo through her text messag and other things the gam is good the only is the presenc of max and the disrespect towards the original characters i am not the pricefield thing it 's okay peopl but the or the way the writers wrot the characters is the chang does n't feel it cam out of growth but rath they are just not the sam characters at all you can chang the and it would n't matt i felt with that ending this was not lif is strang gam it just the of the original gam with pretty graphics and amazing concept but it falls flat one of of the the creators of the the original original lif life is is strang `` '' from what what i i think would not not hav things th the sam way but but i i felt felt th the sam with th the comics comics and before th the storm storm and and i kind of it i i ’ ’ m when i play th the full game i wo n't n't recogniz but that that ’ ’ s s als '' i i do do n't n't recogniz i do do n't n't recogniz the chlo text messag and oth things th the gam game is is good good th the only is the of max max and and the towards th the original characters i i am am not it 's but th the way way th the writers the characters does n't n't feel out of they ar are just just not not th the sam at all you c change th and it it would would n't n't matt i felt that ending this w was not not  a lif life is is strang strange gam game it it just of the the original original gam game with graphics and and a but it,negative
what was that ending was ther even one what was the point nothing really got resolv at all i lik chapters but after that the writing got really bad what w that ending ending w what w was th the point at all all i but aft after that that th the writing really b,negative
might as well the choic matt nothing you do any real the ending most of the characters are the are too short to really get to know any of them anyway deck nin seems to hav forgott that the lif is strang was nev about `` '' sup powers '' '' but about friendship and making choic it 's major step down even from deck nin 's `` '' tru colors '' '' which also fail to captur lot of the great elements of do n't nod 's in the first two gam the gam lik poorly execut fan servic bringing back max and giving us nothing in return but extra for cat content what jok its really the performanc wer pretty great from hannah tell especially do bett d might  as well the choic choices matt you d any real the ending most of of the the characters characters ar too short get t to know any of of them deck nin seems t to hav that th the lif life is is strang strange w was nev `` '' '' '' '' but it 's deck nin nine 's `` '' true colors '' '' a lot lot of of the elements of do n't n't nod in the the first first tw the gam like  poorly execut fan servic back max max and cat content were pretty hannah tell,negative
disrespectful to anything the first gam represent bland unoriginal nostalgi bait i felt lik this seri start going downhill in lis and even mor so in lis i thought things wer looking up in lis with the environment and storytelling but damn was this disappointment first of all do n't wast your money on the dlc it does not add very much to the story itself and i would lov for thes unoriginal to to sav this story from being even mor this was obviously extremely rush of bugs and glitch terribl dialog odd choic you 're basically forc to flirt with everyon and i felt connection to any of the characters besid gwen the only charact to hav som charact development and the of anoth gam is insan with what also if you 're an achievement lik know that you will hav to play the gam at least tim to be able to get all of the achievements many of them are romanc bas ple eith hand this gam back to the original creators or list to your fan bas if i could rewind tim and prevent myself from playing this gam i would in disrespectful t the first first gam i felt felt lik like this this seri in lis lis and and ev even mor in lis lis i i thought up in in lis lis with with th was this this  a disappointment of all do n't your money on the the dlc it do does not much t to th the story and i i would to sav save this this story from being even mor this w bugs and choices you you 'r forced t flirt with and i i felt connection t to any any of of the the characters the only to hav character development and the another gam game is with what if you you 'r like m know that that you you will will hav have t to play play th the gam game at at least to b be abl able t to get all of of the the achievements of them them ar this gam back t to th the original original creators listen t to your if i i could rewind tim time and playing this this gam game i i would in a,negative
so many things to lik about this gam but so very many mor to dislik it the biggest problem is the fact that they releas the gam in stat and they still hav n't giv players as much as an of the issu you hav chanc to encount you in the gam or first into it the animations are buggy som animations do n't play som parts seem straight up unfinish or at least then ther 's the issu of them the from the last gam by lik when the graphics almost look wors compar to tru colors not to mention the issu that still are n't regardless of the `` '' fix patch '' '' could n't even the bit of optimization for this gam now technical issu asid making sequel to the original gam was such bad mov when you knew both endings could n't be fully i lik seeing max in this new environment and the ways in which she 's grown and chang but the gam should 've been mad bas only on the bay ending and not both of them and speaking of chang to max ther 's som that really max is now weirdly flirty and sometim mean and cold not at all lik the awkward and yet max from the first gam again this could be writt off as peopl changing as they age but such big shift in personality with really for it feels weird to the new characters introduc are mostly fun i especially lik safi but i almost feel lik the gam could be bett with whol new protagonist and not max with max returning hannah tell mak as the voic of max which i lov but unfortunately it seems ther is something truly wrong with the voic direction of the gam the voic hannah tell puts on for max in this gam compar to the original is very different i do n't understand why becaus i lov hannah tell 's normal voic in and such but her she is mad to speak in low and kind of then ther 's the interesting choic of bringing back befor the storm chlo as the voic of chlo for the scen inste of original lif is strang chlo i guess it would be okay but becaus of the voic direction the performanc for chlo in this gam nothing lik the voic she gav her in befor the storm which just mak it sound lik whol different charact anyway ther are several things to enjoy about the gam lik the soundtrack new interesting story som moments of max on the past etc but at the moment i ca n't recommend buying this gam if you 're fan of the seri lik this gam feels lik an to the fandom in many ways if you 're new to the seri this gam will honestly not mak lot of sens to you sinc it 's so tied to the first gam which is anoth thing why is this being as something that is very to play as your first lif is strang gam overall i 'd say it might be worth your money on sal if they fix the performanc and visual issu but it still probably is n't worth your tim so many things t to lik like about about this this gam game but it the the biggest is the the fact fact that that they the gam game in in a and they as an of the the issu you hav have  a chanc in the the gam it the do n't some parts at least then ther there 's 's the of them from th the last last gam when th the graphics compared t true colors not t to mention mention th are n't regardless of of the the `` `` '' '' '' could n't even th bit of for this this gam technical issu a sequel sequel t to th the original original gam game w such  a bad when you you knew both endings could n't n't be i lik seeing max max in in this and the in which she 's but th the gam 've b on the the bay bay ending ending and and not both of of them them and speaking of to max there 's 's som max is at all like th awkward and max from from th the first first gam again this this could could b off as as they such  a big for it it feels to m me th the new new characters but i feel lik like th the gam game could could b be bett with  a whol and not with max hannah tell as the the voic of max which i i lov it seems there is is something with th the voic of the the gam game th the voic hannah tell for max max in in this this gam compared t to th the original is very i do do n't n't understand understand why i lov love hannah hannah tell but her she is in a kind of then ther there 's 's the choice of before th the storm chloe  as the the voic of chlo chloe for for th instead of original lif life is is strang chloe i i guess it would because of of the the voic the performanc for chlo chloe in in this this gam like th the voic her in in befor before th the storm like  a whol there ar things t to enjoy about th the gam game lik like th a new of max on the the past but at at the the moment i ca ca n't n't recommend this gam game if if you you 'r fan of of the the seri like m this gam game feels feels lik to th if you you 'r new t to th the seri this gam game will make  a lot lot of to you since it it 's 's so to th the first first gam game which which is why is something that that is is very to play play  first lif life is is strang strange gam i 'd might b worth your your money on sal sale if if they the performanc issues but but it is n't worth your your tim,negative

very mix review i ’ ve just the gam and whil i hav lot of thoughts on it i ’ ll break them down into cle pros cons without any spoilers at first incred music – without the music in this gam is the for it the perfectly and is probably the i enjoy most stunning visuals – the graphics are absolutely the to colors and overall design really the experienc impressiv facial expressions – the facial animations are emotions that mak the characters feel real and new pow – the new gameplay pow is fresh and something to the experienc characters – the new characters are all well out with interesting most of them feel to the narrativ with non coming off as or early episod – episod and are incredibly engaging and kept on the of my the entir tim and – whil the averag gameplay is around hours i spent about hours on my first playthrough to my to explor every and ther ’ s to find for thos who enjoy voic acting – the voic acting is with each charact feeling by the voic pow – whil the new pow is cool i felt it wasn ’ t to its full potential it could hav been with mor or consequenc lack of meaningful choic – one of the of the lif is strang seri always been the choic that you to stop and think unfortunately i didn ’ t feel most of my decisions had much impact in this gam i mad most choic and they didn ’ t hav the weight i expect plot hol questions – this gam is with unresolv plot points and story hol by the end i found myself by all the that nev got up lgbtq+ representation – as of the lgbtq+ i ’ m all for representation howev in this gam it feels whil i appreciat having every charact be part of the lgbtq+ feels mor would hav been dlc – som of the you to dlcs which feel lik the dlcs lik extra outfits and cat which should hav been in the bas gam pric content – whil the gam ’ s graphics and design are impressiv the overall experienc doesn ’ t feel worth the full pric i ’ d recommend waiting for sal to get bett limit – despit the stunning graphics ther ’ s lack of locations to explor the world feels small than i would hav lik especially giv the put into the design visuals sound gameplay characters overall i ’ d giv this gam despit the impressiv music visuals and voic acting the lack of meaningful choic and the of plot hol really it back as much as i want to lov it the story just didn ’ t liv up to i ’ d recommend this to lif is strang fans but don ’ t expect it to the first gam or your new favorit in the seri a very i ’ the gam game and and whil while i i hav have  a lot lot of it i i ’ ’ ll the music in this this gam game is is the for m and is i enjoy – the the graphics graphics ar the experienc facial expressions – the the facial facial animations make th the characters new pow – the the new power is is a a fresh to th the experienc – the the new new characters characters ar most of of them to th the narrativ narrative with off as episodes and on the of my the entir – whil while th hours i to explor there ’ ’ s to find for thos those wh voice acting – the the voic voice acting acting is each charact – whil while th the new new pow power is i felt wasn ’ ’ t could hav have b lack of one of of the of the the lif life is is strang strange seri has always always b choices that you t didn ’ ’ t t feel most of of my in this this gam game i and they didn ’ ’ t t hav have th plot hol this gam game is by the the end end i i found found myself all the as a of the i ’ ’ m in this this gam game it while i i appreciat part of of the a mor would hav have b some of of the you t feel lik like  and a have b in the the b – whil while th the gam ’ s graphics and the overall doesn ’ ’ t t feel worth th the full i ’ ’ d recommend waiting waiting for for  a sal to get there ’ ’ s lack of to explor i would would hav into th overall i i ’ ’ d give this this gam game  voice acting lack of choices and and the plot hol as much much  as i i want wanted t love it it the the story didn ’ ’ t up to i ’ ’ d life is is strang don ’ ’ t it to the first first gam game or in the the seri,positive
overall i enjoy the gam and think most fans of the seri will too howev it does hav good of spoilers • this was clearly mad with limit budget which explains the gam ’ s with limit choic small cast and small • the of the story is good i lik the story and how it can lead to other entri in the seri howev the and dialog of the story is • choic don ’ t really hav any impact on the story and inste lead to som different dialog options inste of completely different scen with the romanc options to the most • ther ’ s choic s in the first gam which back to the limit budget they don ’ t appe to hav the to mak branching which explains how they handl the of bay decision in this installment • som scen wer handl poorly and don ’ t tak into som of your for exampl you ’ ll learn an important piec of information and in lat scen when it com up max completely surpris lik it ’ s the first tim she ’ s heard it or you ’ ll see charact step outsid and on the few and talk to anoth charact who you wher said person is and max she doesn ’ t know lik you can literally see that charact outsid the com on that ’ s just lazy • it was in the personal moments lik the first gam and tru colors doubl exposur ’ s version of tru colors ’ was big step down • the are limit and very small well small than the previous gam with only of npcs and characters you can speak too they seem small and less than the first gam and tru colors it of ’ s with few npcs around and even ’ s and it just feels so in again this from limit budget • due in part to the small the is way too easy and doesn ’ t hav the of the branching outcom lik the first gam • audi is the music is too out dialog but at least you can easily low that in the settings the big problem is dialog audi which is often way too even at max settings and my to full in addition when having max would speak clearly at certain level and often the other s dialog would com in far too low in and with sound • the soundtrack is big step down from the first gam it ’ s not bad it ’ s just completely • ther are som points wher if you to certain plac it you to the next scen without and you ’ ll be to go back to complet anything you miss in the previous are you rel the last checkpoint • which is really annoying if you want to replay the gam or rel the last checkpoint if you miss something due to the • the final episod was the it seems lik tru wher they clearly out of tim money and need to things up howev it was good setup for the next gam and i lik the direction the sequel appears to be going in despit its i did enjoy my tim with the gam and i recommend it overall i i enjoy enjoyed th the gam game and fans of of the the seri however it it do have  a good this w with  limited budget the gam ’ s • the of the the story story is is good good i i lik the story story and lead t in the the seri however th of the the story story is don ’ ’ t impact on on the the story story and lead t instead of with th the romanc romance options to th the most there ’ ’ s in the the first first gam game which back t to th limited budget don ’ ’ t to hav have th to mak how they they handl handled th in this don ’ ’ t some of of your for exampl you ’ ’ ll piece of and in in a when it like it it ’ ’ s the first ’ s it or you ’ ’ ll see  a charact a few talk t and max doesn ’ ’ t you c on that ’ s s just it was in the like th the first first gam game and true colors double exposur ’ s version of true colors was  a big • the and very than th the previous previous gam with only only a you c than th the first first gam game and true colors ’ s with  a few ’ s it just limited budget to th way to doesn ’ ’ t t hav have th of the like th the first first gam at least you c in the the big big problem which is way to at max at a a certain the oth • the the soundtrack is a a big from th the first first gam game it it ’ ’ s it ’ ’ s s just there ar are som if you to  a certain you t to th the next and you you ’ ’ ll to g back t in the the previous the last which is is really if you you want want t to replay replay th the gam game or the last if you due t to th • the the final was th it seems out of however it it was was  a good for th the next next gam game and and i i lik like th the direction the sequel appears t to b i did my tim with th the gam game and and i recommend it,positive

this gam is difficult to recommend and i would 've lov mix her i lik many aspects of it but also many other things let giv you list of both and then you can if this is something for you this gam is sequel to the original lif is strang gam which i lik lot returning to max caulfield felt great she felt the sam but older the gam really tak your final choic of that gam into but i did n't lik what they chos for max and chlo if you chos `` '' her '' '' in the ending of the first gam the rest would be story spoilers and i n't talk about any of them so her 's my list of things i lik and what i lik was the beginning of the story i really enjoy the first thre chapters befor they went in direction with chapters and that i felt mix about the graphics look beautiful the facial animations look incred and the characters feel aliv they did good job showing the emotions max still felt lik max and her voic once again did great job with her i also the run option so you do n't hav to hold to at decent i also really enjoy the at the end if you chos the chlo ending in the first lif is strang gam what i did n't lik wer quit few things it felt lik most of the choic did n't matt becaus they did n't hav hug impact on the story most choic also wer n't very well becaus the of players pick one option over the other and i feel great choic is one wher peopl are really the gam also had som boring moments that seem to be ther just to out gam tim but still the gam is kind of short i also really how few locations ther wer in the gam i would 've lov to see many mor even though you to som of them it start to feel also in the last chapt ther 's big decision moment wher you do n't get to mak the decision yourself which felt strang i also think the gam sometim to certain on the play which felt at tim last but not least many are left unresolv and the last two chapters felt off and did n't carry the sam emotional weight that i expect from the seri as you can see i felt really mix about this experienc this is why i would 've lov mix option i appreciat that this gam is low it 's € inste of € lik tru colors but it still felt for what you get i feel lik € would be perfect pric for this experienc so i 'd recommend waiting for sal befor buying it all in all if i hav to choos to recommend it or not i 'd say it 's worth it when it 's on sal and if you 're hug fan of the seri in the end i had enough fun with this gam and coming back to max felt great i ca n't wait to see wher her next journey tak her without anything i hop it on different characters or to chlo if you chos that option in the first gam it 's disappointing that the beginning was sol but left mix by the end still i hop for the best for the seri and i 'm curious about the next gam this gam game is and i i would would 'v 've lov a mix here i i lik aspects of of it it but and then then you you c this is this gam game is is a a sequel to th the original original lif life is is strang strange gam game which which i i lik a lot to max max caulfield the sam the gam of that but i i did did n't n't lik what they max and and chlo if you you chos `` '' '' '' in the the ending of the the first first gam game th the rest would b and i any of of them i lik what i i lik was th the beginning beginning of of the the story story i i really really enjoy enjoyed th the first in a chapters and and that that i i felt about th the graphics the facial facial animations and the the characters they d did  a good felt lik like max max and once again did  a great with h i als you d do n't have t to hold at a i als also really really enjoy enjoyed th at the the end if you you chos chose th the chlo in the the first first lif life is is strang strange gam what i i did did n't n't lik quite  a few it felt felt lik most of of the the choic did n't they d did n't n't hav have  a hug impact on on the the story very well over th the oth and i i feel a great people ar the gam seemed t to b game tim but still the gam game is kind of i als also really there wer in the the gam game i i would would 'v 've lov to se even though some of of them in the the last there 's 's a a big where you you d do n't get t to mak make th i als also think think th the gam a certain on the the play at tim and the the last two chapters did n't the sam that i from th the seri series  you c can se i felt about this this is i would would 'v 've lov a mix i appreciat that this this gam game is it 's instead of true colors but it for what what you you get i feel feel lik would b be  for this so i i 'd recommend waiting waiting for for  a sal it all in all if i i hav have t to choos recommend it it or or not i 'd say it it 's when it it 's 's on on sal and if if you you 'r 're  a hug fan of of the the seri in the the end end i i had with this this gam game and back t to max i ca ca n't n't wait wait t to se see wher i hop if you you chos in the the first first gam game it it 's that th the beginning by the the end i hop for th the best for th the seri and i i 'm about th the next next gam,positive

this new gam an amazing soundtrack cool new pow and an interesting story i lov the first chapters but the last not so much it was disappointing ther wer so many plot hol and questions important aspects of the story as well as littl details ’ t explain well and feel which is pretty lot of peopl didn ’ t lik what they did with chlo but i ’ m kind of in the middl i lov her and i ’ d definitely rath she was in the gam happy and with max but i also think the direction they was realistic and mad sens even if it wasn ’ t what most of us want unlik the other lif is strang gam wher i up or felt deeply this one the and emotional weight ther wer few moments and several scen mad how i lov max 's and but overall it the emotional they always hav the choic didn ’ t feel lik they matter much but i need to replay it and mak different choic to see for myself if ther ’ s actually much differenc even though it ’ s perfect and i ’ m not sur how i feel about the direction they ’ re taking i ’ m really happy to see max again and excit for the sequel i choos to keep my up this new game h new pow and an an interesting story i i lov loved th the first but th the last so much it was there wer plot hol aspects of of the the story as well well  ’ t which is is pretty a lot lot of of peopl didn ’ ’ t what they they d with chlo chloe but but i i ’ ’ m kind of in the the middl i lov her and and i i ’ ’ d she w in the the gam with max but i i als also think think th the direction direction they realistic and even if if it wasn ’ ’ t most of of us unlike th the oth life is is strang strange gam this on there wer were  a few made m how i i lov max 's have th the choic didn ’ ’ t t feel feel lik like they but i need t to replay it and and mak to se there ’ ’ s even though though it it ’ ’ s and i i ’ ’ m not sur how i i feel about th the direction direction they ’ re i ’ ’ m to se max again for th the sequel sequel i to keep,positive

lif is strang doubl exposur as fan of the franchis is gam you want to lov but unfortunately it mak it difficult to do so the gam of the seri are present in this gam graphics and music of characters with you over tim focus on emotions and connection many choic that can lead to different outcom and of cours big problem you with your one important to the play in are characters at its lis memor characters that many of us still hold unfortunately doubl exposur miss the her whil ther is whol of characters most of them do n't feel quit right or are n't ther 's something in the way the characters look and as they went with mor realistic style etc but mad the characters hav strang too big for and hav them be very the and often feel becaus ther 's this they to everything som characters lik safi pull and find way mor and than they are it 's to watch and mak it hard to car about safi which is pretty bad considering her in this story anoth issu wher things felt forc is the use of lis always been towards it was natural part of the seri you could always romanc you lik best and that 's still possibl in lis doubl exposur but this tim they so heavily into this that almost nothing else is left and it just felt forc every charact is or few or struggl with i 'm part of the and it 's to hav representation but when your gam is pretty much nothing else anymor then it does n't feel natural or believ anymor they really did too much anoth somewhat issu is the way are handl in this new gam we got to know characters and our relationships with them evolv which mad them feel believ not so much her this tim we mostly just get by the gam that we do lik certain characters the gam already for us that we lik safi and car much about her why we do n't know we just do anoth exampl the gam start and we lik amand the really much despit not her and our objectiv is now to to ask her for and do lin on her we did n't even hav any interactions with her yet but she 's supp to be our main lov interest in this gam the only excus for this is that this is one of amand 's personal struggl liking peopl too much too but let 's be real it 's mostly lazy writing sam with or gwen the gam heavily us towards liking them and caring about them but why is annoying and on person who 's not singl all gam and to anoth charact 's why would we lik her one of the few in the gam that felt natural was the to mos as it grew over tim as we got to know him mor this mad sens amand did hav one or two moments lat on that to real reason we might lik her too although they it too hard in the beginning but in way it felt lik all in this gam wer by the despit of thos characters being unlik or shallow sad was that the gam chlo and arcadi bay tim in the gam but we nev get to see her in person which considering the abiliti characters in the gam hav could easily hav been put into the gam mayb something they to do in the next part hopefully anoth problem was how littl our choic seem to hav this tim around sur we mak our choic but the outcom feels mor due to them certain parts to set up sequel this down the of our choic in the first lis our decisions wer hard and meaningful we had to choos betw our best or whol of peopl and we could n't hav it both in the lis about the two our choic what kind of person our littl would into and which of us would even but this tim around both final choic are to pretty much the sam with only minor the story feels okay but the just do n't feel high and decisions do n't mak enough of differenc lis 's was and doubl exposur to in its something went really in the of the final chapt we 're in the middl of the final it 's up we 're trying few small things and suddenly well suddenly our charact something along the lin of `` '' i 'm so we it all '' '' and everything is fin i was and thought this must be of our main charact befor we get to the actual resolution of the ther just is end at all it 's just over without us doing anything or making choic everything is suddenly okay everyon and all that is for nothing and to set up at that once that weight to two unlik peopl from this part that was so visuals sound gameplay characters story as whol this gam is the of getting and being `` '' that must 've been the best you ever had '' '' but you did n't even com sur the gam experienc overall was still and sometim fun but ther 's lot to about it too and ultimately you 're getting of prop for fans of the seri i think it 's still worth playing but it does n't hold to the first few gam still bett than tru colors though i hop the sequel does bett than doubl exposur if you buy it the bas version is the best option mayb you can get the on sal lat on i the ultimat version and whil lik the cat outfits etc are they really do n't the pric life is is strang strange doubl double exposur as a a fan fan of of the the franchis is a a gam game you you want want t to d of the the seri in this this gam graphics and of characters choices that lead t different outcom and of of cours a big big problem the play of us double exposur there is is a a whol of characters most of of them do n't n't feel are n't there 's in the the way way th the characters as they with  a mor the characters and hav there 's like safi they ar it 's hard t to car care about which is is pretty in this this story is the use of of lis has always always b it was was  part of of the the seri you could and that that 's 's still in lis double exposur but this this tim nothing els and it it just just felt a few i 'm part of of the and it it 's to hav game is is pretty pretty much nothing els it do does n't n't feel too much issue is is the the way in this this new got t to know characters and with them so much this tim by the the gam game that the gam game h like safi safi and do n't n't know just d the gam game h her and for  did n't n't ev with h she 's supposed t to b in this this gam game th for this this is is that that this this is one of too much let 's it 's the gam on a 's not game and like h one of of the in the the gam game that that felt was th as it as we got t to know on that like h in the the beginning but in in a a way way it it felt felt lik in this this gam by the that th the gam chloe and arcadia bay in the the gam game but get t to se her in considering th characters in in the the gam have b into th the gam to d in the the next our choic seem t to hav this tim time around our choic but th the outcom due t certain parts set up up a a sequel down th our choic in the the first first lis to choos a whol of peopl could n't n't hav in the the lis about th the tw our choic kind of of us but this this tim time around choices ar pretty much the sam with only the story but th just d do n't n't feel do n't of a double exposur in the of the the final we 'r in the the middl middle of of the the final it 's we 'r a few along th of `` `` '' i 'm it all '' '' everything is i was be  get t to th the actual of the at all it 's 's just everything is all that set up up a that w as a a whol this gam game is is the `` '' 've b the best '' '' you d did n't n't ev the gam and sometim there 's 's a a lot about it you 'r of a a prop fans of of the the seri i think think it it 's 's still but it it do does n't to th the first better th true colors though i i hop the sequel better th double exposur if you buy it it the the b the

early access thoughts i lov the original lif is strang gam i even enjoy befor the gam are fantastic howev doubl exposur falls short in the of the first two the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ part is how they handl max an entir for chlo and yet they had chlo break up with max through that just does n't feel tru to the relationship even if they wer going through chlo ’ t just giv up and leav that said if you set asid that doubl exposur lot going for it the graphics are stunning and the facial animations are som of the best i ’ ve seen the story is engaging with sol cast of characters but i just didn ’ t feel strong connection to safi who you ’ re supp to car about the most she doesn ’ t hav the sam emotional pull that chlo had in the original gam it almost feels lik max wasn ’ t meant to be the protagonist this tim around howev with thre mor chapters on the way i ’ m that the gam will thes issu and chlo and max doubl exposur som strong with certain parts of the story being genuinely enjoy howev too many plot points felt unresolv the story an feel it ’ s cle they ’ re setting up for dlc or sequel but this focus on futur content from conclusion the ending felt almost as if it ended the story feeling just unlik the first lif is strang gam i ’ t find myself truly caring about most of the characters gwen and mos out as but the rest didn ’ t really with the gam seem to for connection with safi as if trying to replac chlo as max ’ s best friend but she cam as forc and don ’ t even get start on safi basically trying to the lif is strang i also am to bring up which still ’ t max and chlo this lack of around the relationship only to my with safi and the romanc options her as i still believ max and chlo should nev hav been up becaus it mak sens for chlo to just max becaus she ’ s `` '' fre '' '' but enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and about how bad doubl exposur is ther are som good aspects her hannah tell ’ s performanc as max caulfield is incred she truly in the of this gam and is the main reason i with it to complet the gam to the end max caulfield will always be one of my favorit characters and hannah tell ’ s is hug part of what mak her great the graphics are fantastic with each feeling and real the voic acting is superb as well the entir cast did fantastic job but i could say whol lot mor but then this would be book so all things i would this gam about and if i 'm being i honestly to say it becaus i want to lik this gam but i don ’ t think they can the that the original lif is strang gam had so if you 're fan or someon who lik chlo i would say sav your money becaus you probably n't enjoy this gam howev if you ’ re new fan or didn ’ t lik chlo you might find it enjoy but it ’ s still bett to wait for sal i lov loved th the original original lif life is is strang strange gam double exposur of the the first first tw the most part is how they they handl an entir chloe and they h up with with max through  does n't n't feel even if if they through  ’ t if you double exposur has  a lot it the the graphics graphics ar and the the facial facial animations are som some of of the the best i ’ the story story is with  of characters but i i just didn ’ ’ t t feel to safi you ’ ’ re supposed t to car care about about th the most doesn ’ ’ t t hav have th the sam in the the original original gam game it it almost feels lik like max wasn ’ ’ t to b the protagonist this tim time around on the the way way i i ’ ’ m that th the gam chloe and and max double exposur has som with certain certain parts parts of of the the story the story it ’ ’ s ’ re setting up for  but this the ending as if if it the story unlike th the first first lif life is is strang strange gam ’ t most of of the the characters but th the rest didn ’ ’ t the gam seemed t for  with safi as if trying t as max ’ s as a don ’ ’ t trying t the lif life is is strang i als ’ t max and and chlo lack of with safi safi and and the the romanc romance options as i i still max and and chlo have b because it ’ s a `` `` '' '' '' double exposur exposure is there ar are som hannah tell ’ s as max max caulfield in the of this this gam game and and is is the the main with it it to the gam game t to th the end max caulfield one of of my my favorit characters and hannah tell ’ s is a a hug part of of what great th the graphics graphics ar the voic voice acting acting is as well the entir did  a fantastic but i i could a whol but th would b be  i would this gam and if if i i 'm a i say it i want wanted t this gam game but but i don ’ ’ t that th the original original lif life is is strang strange gam so if if you you 'r 're  someone wh i would would say your money enjoy this this gam if you you ’ ’ re a new didn ’ ’ t but it it ’ ’ s wait for for  a sal,positive

doubl exposur left on the one hand it is beautiful and mak good use of great soundtrack the dialog is well writt and the voic acting generally superb after my at the of chlo from the gam asid from and the of max 's powers into univ hopping rath than tim travel i want to with the new cast of characters max 's two choic of lov interest and see how jumping betw two could affect the narrativ and the outcom of the gam on the other hand despit som really great and dialog i found the actual story to be for the of the gam though the dialog is well writt almost all of that is not only max 's dialog it is her her inner thoughts that one but the play this an experienc thos new powers that seem so promising felt quit limit and lik they to seri of and thos new characters felt shallow even mor so over the cours of the gam becaus all that univ hopping meant that i was really only half the tim at best with any one version of them they had of any of the very few meaningful interactions i 'd had with them once i making the of real feeling relationships imposs ultimately it did n't feel lik max 's powers had any real impact on the outcom of the story did they leav with the that i 'd really that journey i did n't feel lik i 'd mad my version of max that the endings that all thes gam to hav unlik say in lis tru colors wher i felt lik i 'd my own version of i found this older version of max much mor sympathetic and immediately than the original version of the original lis gam this max is by her past and matur enough to understand that ther are som things you just hav to in lif she feels lik she 's been through which is certainly especially if you chos to sav chlo in the first gam and let arcadi bay be literally away howev this max is still an she 's still despit both her and the story us that she at caledon colleg wher chlo acted as to max lif and fun and into that first story ther is n't charact to do that for max her sur ther 's mos but 's just as much of an as she is even she 's left two of him even when she her univ hopping abiliti in him it 's not at all lik when max her abiliti with chlo which triggers seri of moments deal in of max 's lack of impact is safi death triggers the whol story i felt lik i got to know safi and i hav to say that i did n't lik her her death was to with only max 's to it making feel much of anything about it in the original lis max nev even rachel who is the big of that story but through chlo 's feelings about rachel and chlo being mor sympathetic and generally interesting charact i cam to car about what had happen to rachel i nev really all that much about what happen to safi which is big problem sinc her death triggers the entir doubl exposur story even mor is that even though max to be by safi 's death she almost tim with safi once she that she can betw the timelin in which safi was and second timelin wher safi is still aliv for chapt and half i grew annoy that max did n't out safi and every possibl second with her becaus max should already hav that everything is and com with pric especially in to her powers in fact she even that ther 's always pric at least once but seems to her own i do hav several of doubl exposur and it certainly is n't my favorit gam in the seri that would be tru colors for the way the powers connection with the characters as to how the powers max from everyon in doubl exposur by them all into two shallow i still enjoy my tim at caledon colleg for my max is and sympathetic enough that i ultimately did feel for her by the end of the story even if non of the other characters matter to i certainly understand peopl this gam though becaus the developers it or not doubl exposur seem unlik the original lis or tru colors which wer all about the protagonist to anoth or several others in tru colors through the use of the powers and as as it might hav been for the experienc double exposur on the the on it is use of of a a great is well well writt and the the voic voice acting at the from th the gam aside from and the of max max 's universe hopping rather th time travel i want wanted t with th new cast of characters max 's between tw the narrativ and the the outcom of the the gam on the the oth i found found th the actual to b for th of the the gam is well well writt all of of that is not not only only max max 's it is her inn but th the play like they new characters even mor over th of the the gam all that universe hopping that i i was was really the tim time at at best version of of them they h any of of the the very i 'd with them once i it did did n't n't feel feel lik like max max 's impact on on the the outcom of the the story with th that i i 'd i did did n't n't feel feel lik like i i 'd version of of max these gam to hav in lis true colors i felt felt lik like i i 'd my own version of i found version of of max than th the original version of of the the original original lis max is enough t that ther there ar are som have t feels lik she 's through  which is especially if if you you chos chose t in the the first first gam game and and let arcadia bay max is is still she 's 's still still  her and and the the story that sh at caledon as a to max fun and into that there is is n't a charact to d there 's he 's 's just just  as much much of as she she is she 's universe hopping it 's 's not at all when max with chlo of max max 's lack of the whol story i i felt felt lik like i got t to know safi and and i i hav have t say that that i i did did n't like h her death was  to m with only only max max 's much of about it in the the original original lis is the the big of that story but feelings about and chlo a mor character i to car care about happened t never really all that that much happened t to safi which is is a a big big problem her death the entir double exposur even mor is that even though to b safi 's with safi that sh between th and a a second safi is is still for  chapter and and a that max did n't safi and with h everything is with  to h that ther there 's at least seems t i do double exposur and it is n't my favorit game in in the the seri would b true colors for th the way way th with th the characters how th in doubl double exposur i still still enjoy my tim time at at caledon max is that i for h by the the end end of of the the story even if of the the oth other characters to m this gam game  the developers it or or not double exposur unlike th the original original lis true colors about th the protagonist true colors use of as it might hav have b for th the experienc,positive
the first two chapters are very enjoy for thos who are of i 'll list som pros and cons that i personally pros spoil fre the gam is visually great and i lov the expressions of the characters though i do i miss the style of the old gam bit the seem realistic and bit less than the previous gam though even without the i believ the of max is very well the story so far been incredibly interesting to the point i hav n't thinking about it and i want to replay the first two chapters over and over to see all the different outcom i feel lik all decisions carry weight in your gameplay not just the mor `` '' '' '' choic cons spoil fre i hav encounter som fps mostly during scen though ther hav been issu during such as are missing for and one of the characters for moment lol on the sid this is n't the of gam wher lag the again with the graphics i 've the shadows are the most setting and yet ther 's only few settings for medium high i 'd lov if `` '' low '' '' setting could be in the futur as the performanc with shadows is yet incredibly to look at now i 'll som pros and cons that spoilers so avo this next if you 've not play the gam or gameplay overall i 'm with this gam and would definitely recommend it the rest of the chapters can hold up to the first two the first first tw two chapters chapters ar for thos those wh i 'll and cons that i the gam game is great and and i i lov love th of the the characters though i i do miss th of the the old game  a bit realistic and and a a bit than th the previous previous gam of max max is very well the story so f has b to th the point i hav about it it and and i want t to replay replay th the first first tw two chapters to se all the different outcom i feel feel lik `` '' '' '' i hav have b been  one of of the the characters for  on the this is is n't n't the with th the graphics i 've the most there 's 's only only a a few i 'd a `` `` '' '' '' in the the futur as the the performanc now i i 'll and cons if you you 'v played th the gam game or overall i i 'm with this this gam game and recommend it the rest rest of of the up to to th the first first tw,positive

lif is strang doubl exposur is mix that som interesting and promising start but ultimately to liv up to the potential of its and of trying to the narrativ of the seri in to direction that at least i am not too excit about whil it was great to be playing as max caulfield again i hav to that ther wer multipl moments i found myself thinking that the story they could hav also just an original charact inste as it felt that the wer mor interest in using max as charact than the wer interest in writing about max as charact that being said i did enjoy episod to just that and wer n't great the gameplay nev really evolv or the tim in an interesting way and overall the whol thing was mix do i think it is worth playing why not it is not disast but i would absolutely recommend waiting for sal life is is strang strange doubl double exposur exposure is is a a mix that h has som and a up to to th trying t the narrativ of the the seri to  at least i am not to it was to b playing  as max max caulfield i hav have t that ther there wer i found found myself that th the story could hav also just as it it felt felt that that th were mor interested in max  as a a charact than th interested in max  as a a charact said i i did just that that and great th never really an interesting the whol was  a mix i think think it it is it is is not not  but i i would recommend waiting waiting for for  a sal,positive
as chlo the and play this yes you 'll miss her and yes it 's littl starting off i think it on its slightly in the beginning that just having max will get and keep our interest rath than to it but it 's also worth as episod and in are characters the plot had hook what start as i 'll finish episod turn into an to finish it becaus it was just that the animations and va in wer top really gorgeous and ther was som fantastic to i wish they would down the and of lin and mak them play but that 's i had fantastic playing this deck nin my trust as a you 'll her and it 's 's a off i i think think it in the the beginning max will rather th but it it 's episodes and and in the plot i 'll because it it was was just just that and ther there w i wish they would down th but that that 's 's a i had had  a fantastic deck nin,positive
as tim lis fan i 'm gon na be and say this is easily the one though i really enjoy the new characters and the overall story gwen is so hot i the journal non of it looks lik something max would ever seeing how this is after the original it would only mak sens that her would 've inste of going down the weird off looking she is doing now i 'm also deeply by the colors and choic i when max pick up the and said `` '' its my '' '' lik that i 'm not saying it to be actually but its lik they did n't even try to mak it look lik it one of my favorit part of the gam is through the and reading every singl to truly myself in the world of the protagonist which is why is so lol the previous gam hav all the and i think its major part of the franchis so it up this bad is i would also lik to how lazy the are felt it beautiful but with it mad i did not lik the and though it all i know its in the beginning of the gam and mayb meant to new players into the but my main is definitely the journal though and i think my is pros max is back final outfits cat hot i also really enjoy the it 's lis and they are got keep the aliv shak keep in that i only play the first two episod so far so i 'm hoping i can see past the `` '' '' '' and just enjoy how the story i 'll just hav to wait around hours for the full gam to be out as a i 'm gon n this is though i i really really enjoy enjoy th the new new characters characters and and the the overall is so of it this is after th the original it would that h would 'v instead of down th she is now i i 'm by the when max `` '' '' '' that i i 'm 'm not to b like they they d did n't n't ev to mak make it like it one of of my my favorit part of of the in the of the the protagonist which is is so the previous previous gam and i i think part of of the the franchis i would like t with it made m i did did not like th though it it all i know in the the beginning beginning of of the the gam game and into th and i i think max is is back i als also really really enjoy enjoy th it 's 's a they ar that i i only only play played th the first first tw two episod so f so i i 'm i can can se `` '' '' '' and just how th the story i 'll have t for th the full full gam game t to b,positive

this was pretty much everything i had it was i really enjoy playing through this gam it had good story really characters and som not and max was just as as she was in the first gam i know it 's getting lot of reviews bas on how chlo does n't appe in the gam but as someon who chos to sav arcadi bay in the first lis having her appe would hav been really weird i do lov how max about her lot though even though chlo does n't appe you can tell how important she still is to max i also felt the new powers wer fun chang and it mad dealing with certain parts of the story mor interesting seeing how low the are for this gam currently mak sad i feel lik it much mor than it 's getting i 'm looking to continuation to max 's story again in the futur this w pretty much i had it was i really really enjoy this gam game it had  a good good story characters and and som and max was just just  as she she w in the the first first gam game i i know it 's a lot lot of based on does n't in the someone wh chose t arcadia bay in the the first first lis would hav have b i do a lot even though does n't you c to max i als the new were  and it with certain certain parts parts of of the the story for this this gam i feel feel lik like it it 's i 'm to  to max max 's in the the futur,positive
spoilers doubl exposur is an interesting gam if you 're or someon that found the relationship betw her and max to be of your of the first gam then you should probably this if you 're interest in just mor max it 's good if you 're looking for an narrativ with and believ charact 's main often with its animations and good va work are often by uncle charact and mystery that is by peopl 's to actually speak clearly to max taking of the two you can back and betw most of max 's tim at caledon is down someon for information and nothing of use then to the timelin and and information that them to giv you something -- fact or at an but anything to go off of until the end of the gam most of the at caledon seem to be of the most in betw gwen luc and yasmin you hav thre for the of for poorly explain reasons her book deal is cancell becaus yasmin want it to be for reasons something to safi 's charact and for her decisions is nev explain to max i yasmin was just her from being luc and gwen are n't much bett luc nev tak his and to may 's even mor by the end of the gam 's it off with and acting as if 's away with it despit it disast for him just the past chapt gwen is just weird you hav this things my own way charact safi 's book deal up this interesting and somewhat for why someon especially to safi would do such thing but it into gwen was to do it by yasmin and along with it despit at any other point in the gam talking to max how she 's of for herself at the colleg why she does this at all or why she even to yasmin in the first plac is nev explain becaus inste of getting resolution with her lik everyon else she out and lastly safi herself is real piec of work jumping from an and acting thos who her to someon suddenly having and herself as half the gam i that safi luc and his relationship with his to get back at her for may 's -- inste when max her about this she it off and says `` '' i thought might hav had something with my cancell book deal '' '' actually then you hav with luc to safi becaus suddenly she that she 's supp to actually car about may which in safi that her is actually down of `` '' of the '' '' she actually is the one that cancell safi 's book deal why reasons reasons that explains to you or max in fact the best of the gam is the most minor and wast charact ever alderm detectiv in the is to the murd or of safi despit only into the gam in chapt and making mostly wast in early chapt alderm is play off as and most of all charact from him max chang aspects of reality to his way into her hom and that her entir past is story of death it 's cle that alderm is the first to 's dealing with unfortunately this is immediately wast as alderm from after serious too it 's literally right after the scen and it 's such of charact as the ide of detectiv and cle enough to keep on max 's and know that something strang and is is ide wast detectiv alderm definitely could hav the death not lastly i know lot of peopl are annoy with the of chlo in this gam as well as max 's relationship with her but i think this left peopl far mor curious at the end of the gam max into the storm safi to two imposs choic chlo or her in the first gam despit any of with the first gam max actually to everything and sav the that the storm is n't actually really it 's mor lik minor which i that max will just tim travel back to using the phot she kept the storm and sav both chlo and arcadi right probably not gam would vinh and the again double exposur exposure is an interesting game if if you you 'r 're  found th her and and max to b be  of your of the the first first gam then you if you you 'r interested in it 's 's a a good if you you 'r narrative with and a to max of the the tw you c most of of max max 's time at at caledon to th to g until th the end end of of the the gam most of of the at caledon seem t to b of the the most lucas and you hav for th book deal it to to b to safi safi 's 's charact and a for h to max was just lucas and are n't even mor by the the end end of of the the gam he 's with  as if he 's with it is just you hav my own safi 's book deal to safi such  thing but but it to d with it point in in the the gam to max she 's at the at all in the the first instead of with h out and is a piece of those wh as a the gam game i lucas and to get when max about this `` '' might hav with my book deal '' '' then you you hav have  that sh she 's supposed t care about that h of `` `` '' of the '' '' is the the on safi 's book deal the best of the the gam game is is the the most in the into th the gam game in chapter and off as as a most of aspects of that h is a it 's is the the first he 's with  this is it 's after th and it it 's such  of a a charact as the of a enough t to keep on max max 's is a could hav i know a lot lot of of peopl people ar with th in this this gam as well well  as max max 's with h but i i think think this at the the end end of of the the gam into th the storm her in in the the first first gam with th the first first gam that th the storm is n't it 's like  which i that max max will time travel back t the storm chloe and,positive
i got the advanc access so i only hav access to and play the first two chapters pros are much need over the last gam max looks great but looks alot different which i could see being an issu for som peopl usual for the lif is strang gam chapt left off on hug moment and mad eag to play the next chapters when the full gam rel characters are mor to lik and memor than tru colors i honestly only and the other two main characters from tru colors the other characters in that gam wer pretty and i found myself not caring for them that much so far in doubl exposur ther are mayb only i do n't really car for new pow system they hav for the gam is pretty cool i actually it over the or reading the previous gam had of the dialog choic need mor when them ther wer good of tim wher something cam off alot then how i thought it was gon na com off i know lif is strang always dialog this way but this was the first tim its actually kind enough to it can to dialog and som of it will actually hav things you can do that will up at the end of the chapt when you your choic to what other peopl mak the problem is that this dialog is pretty for exampl i got too far away by and the dialog it would not play anymor and i had to rel checkpoint to get it to play again i need to do this becaus to the whol dialog would something for to do ther is also way to long of betw when two npcs are talking togeth if you 've play think of the long that hav when talking to each other i know the lif is strang seri always had but ther wer of moments wer i my exampl being max saying she the of the outsid the and says something about the lik is that really necessary ther was also anoth moment wher you can see of the last thre are man man and in that if you with the max says something along the lin of `` '' way to be '' '' i may be reading into that too much but giv the in the us it would n't if it was mor than just as befor i currently only hav access to and hav play the first two chapters so i think it would be to giv this gam as of now that being said i enjoy the first two chapters and eag to play the full rel i 'll updat this review if i feel lik i need to anything after i finish the gam when it fully rel i just finish the gam ending was great and it set up futur gam very well pretty with the direction they 're taking the story in i just hop they it advanced access so i i only only hav have access access t to and played th the first first tw two chapters are  over th the last which i i could for som some peopl for th the lif life is is strang strange gam on a a hug made m eager t to play play th the next the full full gam characters ar are mor true colors the oth true colors the oth other characters characters in in that and i i found found myself that much so f in doubl double exposur there ar only a i do do n't n't really new pow they hav for th the gam game is is pretty pretty cool over th the previous of the the dialog there wer were  a good how i it was gon n off i i know life is is strang has always but this this w was th the first enough t and som some of of it it will you c at the the end end of of the when you your choic make th is that that this is pretty for exampl and the the dialog it would and i i had to get get it it to to play to d to th the whol for m to d there is way t if you you 'v 've play of the to each i know the lif life is is strang strange seri has always there wer of the about th is that there w where you you c can se see  the last are  and a in that if you with th along th of `` `` '' way t to b be  '' '' into that too much in the it would would n't if it it was just  only hav have access access t to and and hav played th the first first tw two chapters so i i think think it it would would b give this this gam game  now that said i i enjoy enjoyed th the first first tw two chapters chapters and eager t to play play th the full full rel i 'll if i i feel feel lik like i need t the gam when it i just finished th the gam ending w great and and it set up very well with th the direction direction they they 'r the story i just,positive

i 'm very with this gam the first chapters are incredibly good the music and writing is amazing max 's charact for the most part is really well writt feeling lik herself but matur and lot of the characters are well writt and acted and interesting to learn mor about it is howev an incredibly gam i for one do n't hav problem with how they the chlo to with them being up actually mak alot of sens especially with som of the they hav about why but they nev really as to the actual and it almost feels her up at all at that point it seems lik they want max 's charact to be by the decision but nev to doing so asid from that the story falls short incredibly with the last chapters the writing feels poorly and at tim is just very and although i enjoy the gam it did feel not great after getting to the end and tbh the way the gam is setup you do n't really get to safi so the ending just feels kind at best and unfortunately kind you thinking `` '' what was the point '' it 's really hard for to this i think if you get it on sal and enjoy lif is strang it 's worth playthrough but other than that i 'm not sur i could conclusion max as charact feels and if you want mor of max you will hav great tim the parts that are great really out unfortunately the parts that are poorly writt mak it hard to the good and just you feeling sad for what could hav been i 'm with this this gam game th the first first chapters chapters ar max 's 's charact for th the most part is is really well writt and a a lot lot of of the the characters characters ar are well well writt to learn about it it is game i for on do n't n't hav have  with how how they the chlo with them some of of the they hav never really to th the actual and it it almost at all it seems like they max 's 's charact to b by the aside from that th the story with th the last the writing at tim is just i enjoy enjoyed th the gam game it it did to th the end the way way th the gam game is you d do n't n't really to safi the ending at best `` '' was th the point it 's for m i think if you you get get it on sal life is is strang it 's other th that i i 'm 'm not not sur i could max  as a a charact and if if you you want more of of max you will will hav have  a great that ar are great that ar make it hard t good and and just for what could hav have b,positive

this gam on max 's traum from the original as i would hav it definitely to it than the of tru colours it does also on tru colours lot too only chapt is right now so i 'll updat this review once the full gam is out and i 've finish it but in the her are my thoughts so far the story is good and definitely the best plot we 've seen sinc the original without getting into spoilers you 'll be max 's traum and of cours new mystery unlik tru colours this mystery actually feels important and it 's looking lik it 's going to hav quit lot of as we go through too it does start pretty with chapt it tak it 's tim characters and showing off the which is n't bad thing and then things start to up in chapt overall i 'm hook and very excit to see wher this story the choic are also bett her i think one of my major about tru colours was the lack of real choic nothing you did matter and the gam was pretty her i hav already mad several choic that hav com back to in the with certain characters as usual i this will hav an affect on the overall plot but it definitely does affect relationships with characters which is great certain charact is currently very with and long i 'm curious to see how this out the music so far is great the music is bit of weird choic but everything else very well i especially lik the music when you 're around in certain timelin it 's visually of cours this gam looks fantastic too again great use of colours betw the timelin and the animations her are top it 's definitely deck nin 's strong the characters look great and the facial expressions say lot now let 's talk about som of the issu first of all performanc is bit off i can get it at fps with everything out for shadows medium and medium honestly though i hav n't chang in when thes settings it 's not hug issu sinc it runs well and looks good with thos settings turn down but still i do n't think it 's the of gam that should need that much pow but ther 's also which is pretty the other issu is bugs ther 's nothing gam her or anything too serious i 've only encounter one in my hours that 's happen on two and that 's with for som reason door 's will just in the air it 's weird but it does n't break anything this only ever with an door and again it 's only happen to it 's minor issu but it 's pretty big to bring back i do n't mean waiting betw each episod but the way chapters work currently is `` '' start chapt into the gam get to chapt end her are your choic '' '' i really miss the old feel wher you 'd get of wher each charact was at the end of the episod and wher the story is currently going over then the next episod would start with and then you 'd be back into it it 's small thing but i always thought that was really cool and i really hop d bring that back in the futur i miss it overall i think this is looking promising an interesting narrativ with interesting choic in an interesting setting pretty much what i want from this gam this gam on max max 's from th the original as i i would would hav it definitely has  than th true colours it do true colours a lot right now so i i 'll the full full gam game is is out out and and i i 've it but but in in the here ar so f far th the story story is is good good and the best since th the original you 'll max 's and of of cours a new true colours and it it 's like it it 's going t to hav quite  a lot lot of as we it do it 's characters and which is is n't and then overall i i 'm hooked and and very excited t to se see wher this story the choic choices ar here i i think one of of my true colours was th lack of you d and the the gam game w here i i hav choices that back t in the with certain as usual will hav on the the overall but it it definitely which is a certain i 'm to se the music so f great th is a a bit of a very well well i like th when you you 'r in a a certain it 's 's a of cours this gam use of between th and the here ar it 's deck nin the characters great and facial expressions a lot let 's some of of the is a a bit off i i can can get get it though i i hav it 's 's not not  a hug it runs but still i do do n't think it it 's game that that much there 's which is is pretty the oth issue is there 's i 've 've only in my that 's and that that 's for som in the it 's but it it do does n't it 's 's only happened t to m it 's 's a but it it 's to m i do do n't but th the way `` '' into th the gam get t to  here ar your choic '' '' i really miss th the old where you each charact at the the end end of of the where th the story story is the next with  and then then you it 's 's a thing but but i that w was really and i i really in the the futur overall i i think think this this is an interesting narrative with an interesting pretty much what i i want this gam,positive

i absolutely lis and whil i understand many of the that peopl hav about this sequel i genuinely think this was fantastic addition to the seri as expect with the in the facial expressions and charact are bett than previous titl som parts of the story littl and i did n't quit understand how the resolution cam to be trying to avo spoilers but overall i ended the gam feeling content with the hours i spent with max it felt and just lik the first gam i had playing howev the decisions do not feel as as they did in the first gam in lis you hav two different outcom you can end up with but in this installment it seems matt what choic you mak it you to the sam this is n't bad thing sinc your choic can chang other characters of you and how thos interactions tak plac throughout the story but i do wish ther wer mor endings to explor this gam is definitely setting up for anoth sequel which i will with but i just hop that lot of the decisions we mad in this gam can carry over to that and continu with max the romanc for exampl as for the in the i had the bay ending in the first gam so i felt that my playthrough mad perfect sens and with what i expect to after the ending of lis with that said i do n't feel that i can mak prop on how they handl the bae ending until i go through and replay the story with that choic my final for this gam falls on the romanc this always been very fun sid objectiv in all the lis gam and it 's different her howev i the fact that you through an entir scen hav the option to romanc someon and then ther are mor interactions you can throughout the first few episod with one of two characters but it 's only in episod wher you can actually mak or not beyond that ther really are n't any mor to out or talk with that person i know this is n't the point of the gam but if you 're gon na mak it an option i think ther should be multipl wher you can and explor that as an sid objectiv as i befor i 'm hoping that with the sequel that 's to be we can actually carry over all the choic that wer mad and thes relationships final thoughts the story was unexpect and i found myself enjoying it and following it pretty easily besid som minor and by the characters towards the end i really lov seeing max again in all her her inner was always one of my favorit parts of lis and i felt that they kept that sam in this sequel she felt lik the sam max slightly different facial design and the dialog throughout the gam cam off as realistic and not forc her new pow was fun to use and i enjoy the littl sid you could do lik other characters etc the end chapt as always is fun way to see what other players are doing in the and i enjoy my choic with i am for the futur of lis and i believ deck nin did great job overall with this sequel i ca n't wait to see what max will do next lis and and whil while i of the about this this sequel sequel i think this this w was  a fantastic to th the seri series  with th the facial facial expressions better th parts of of the the story and i i did did n't how th to b trying t overall i the gam with th hours i with max it felt and just like th the first first gam game i i had had  however th the decisions do not as they they d in the the first first gam game in in lis you hav different outcom you c up with but in in this it seems make it you t to th the sam this is is n't your choic other characters throughout th the story story but but i i do there wer were mor to explor this gam game is setting up which i i will but i i just a lot lot of of the the decisions in this this gam to that that and with max the romanc for exampl for th in the i had bay ending in the the first first gam game s so i i felt felt that what i after th the ending of lis with that said i i do do n't n't feel that i i can make  a prop how they they handl handled th the ba bae ending through and replay th the story with that for this this gam on the the romanc has always always b been  a very in all all the the lis lis gam games and and it it 's the fact fact that that you an entir have th the option and then there ar you c throughout th the first one of but it it 's 's only where you you c make  or not that ther are n't with that i know this is is n't n't the the point of the the gam game but but if if you you 'r gon n make it i think should b where you you c as an as i i 'm with th the sequel that 's to b all the the choic choices that the story story w and i i found found myself enjoying it it and by the the characters the end end i i really max again in all her inn one of of my my favorit parts of of lis lis and and i i felt felt that that they in this this sequel felt lik like th the sam and the the dialog throughout th the gam off as realistic and new pow and i i enjoy you could other characters the end is a way t to se see what and i i enjoy i am for th the futur of lis lis and and i deck nin did  a great with this this sequel sequel i i ca ca n't n't wait wait t to se see what max will,positive

the gam is good so far not great but it 's good i do n't really think that the ultimat or edition is worth the pric i 'd say that if you really want to play it just sav yourself the money and buy the version i only really the ultimat edition to avo spoilers and such the graphics in the gam are good i still the original graphics but the graphics in this gam are still good and the so far but i do n't with how they said they would the two endings i did n't feel lik the arcadi bay ending was at all at least if you had to chlo lik i did i hav mix feelings about this gam for sur becaus whil i do feel lik its i still enjoy the gam so far other than the other reasons and som her and ther as to be expect with gam if you want to enjoy the gam but do n't feel lik money sav yourself the and watch playthrough but if you want to play it yourself lik i did that too i do n't regret buying the ultimat edition and playing it for myself but i do overall feel lik it 's not the best decision the gam game is is good so f but it it 's good i i do do n't n't really that th the ultimat worth th the pric i 'd say that if you you really want t to play it just i only the ultimat ultimate edition the graphics in the the gam good i i still the original but th the graphics in this this gam good and and the so f but i i do do n't with how how they they would the tw two endings i did did n't n't feel feel lik like th arcadia bay bay ending ending w at all at least if you like i i did i hav mixed feelings feelings about about this this gam game for while i i do feel lik i still still enjoy enjoyed th the gam game s so f other th than th the oth and som and ther to b if you you want want t enjoy th the gam game but do n't n't feel feel lik but if if you you want want t to play like i i did i do do n't the ultimat ultimate edition but i i do feel lik like it it 's 's not the best,positive
plot is strang doubl exposur the gam is visually great the characters are perfectly and i was able to the 's for and the fin writing of each charact mor max who remains to the one we know from the previous gam on the other hand the story left something to be with certain narrativ elements very even which is to the first lif is strang gam the story seem than the others ther was lack of impact on the possibl choic and the consequenc wer almost i still recommend becaus it felt lik good experienc but it was not worth € or even mor with the two extra dlcs is strang strange doubl double exposur the gam game is great th the characters characters ar and i i was able t each charact to th the on from th the previous previous gam on the the oth the story to b with certain which is to th the first first lif life is is strang strange gam the story than th there w was  lack of impact on on the choices and and the i still because it it felt felt lik like  a good but it it was was not even mor with th the tw,positive
