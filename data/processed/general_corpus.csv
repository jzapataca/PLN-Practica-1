i would refund this game but i 've played hours i want to see how the bad story gets right now is really bad as a lis fan i 'm dissapointed of this game let 's hope the ending is not as stupid as i 've already this game 's mystery is really not a mystery at all btw i would this game game but but i i 've 've played hours i i want want to to see see how how the is really really bad as a a lis i 'm of this this game let 's hope the the ending ending is is not as i i 've this game game 's mystery is is really not a a mystery at all,negative
just finished the last episode a little bit ago and honestly this is some of the worst writing i 've ever seen in a game here are some of my main issues spoilers ahead why did n't max the picture of herself with the when back was turned he was n't looking at her the whole time she could have easily it into her is she stupid there is no up to safi 's mom `` '' '' '' her it just happens out of the blue with no further context given about her about safi 's or the deal why is there another storm it seems like the writers of this game completely misunderstood why the storm was in the first game the first game is all about the effect how small choices can to big changes the storm was n't caused by max 's powers it was caused by chloe being alive there is no reason for the storm to come back other than as a nostalgia bait and a lazy attempt at trying to make things more why did safi even want max to her in the first place i feel like it was not made clear at all and if she wanted to die so badly to prevent whatever she thought was going to happen why did n't she just do it herself so that max would n't get for her death and why did she take a photo that she knew would max and why would they take the from lucas 's if they were trying to prevent max from ever safi are they stupid the choices you make throughout the game have basically no impact and there is one ending linear all of the to lis felt so and once alderman dies it 's that no one him and it seems like it 's going to be kind of a big deal but it 's never brought up again also the fact that max can basically help him seems completely out of character they do n't even to bring this up ever again why is everyone is so horny for max in this game why was the `` '' nightmare '' '' sequence a real event that actually happened in the first game it was made clear that it was just a nightmare in max 's mind but here everyone can see what 's going on it also makes no sense that max and safi just right into the storm max 's new ability to from one reality to another could have been a cool game play mechanic but it 's only ever used twice in cut scenes the cat content is cute is n't worth paying extra money for terrible cash grab from square why did bloom in the of safi 's there 's not even a clue as to why that happened the side characters are bland and i could not care less about most of them giving max the option to offer is extremely out of character and is a lazy option for the final choice safi evil does not make a lot of sense like most of the game it lacks and seems to come out of why is there some third timeline where all the are coming from i 'm sure i could write a lot more but i 'm and ready to be over this game do not recommend playing at all you will be disappointed just finished finished the the last a little and honestly honestly this this is some of of the the worst i 've 've ever ever seen in a some of of my spoilers ahead why did did n't with the was n't at her the whole could have there is is no up to to safi safi 's `` '' '' '' it just out of of the with no about her safi 's why is is there it seems seems like like the the writers of this this game why the the storm was in in the the first first game game the the first first game game is all about about the the storm was n't max 's 's powers powers it it was there is is no no reason reason for for the the storm to come come back other than as a and a trying to to make make things why did max to her in in the the first first place i feel feel like like it it was was not at all all and if she wanted to to die so badly to prevent was going going to to happen why did did n't do it that max max would would n't n't get for her and why why did take a a photo that she max and and why take the if they they were trying to to prevent max from the choices choices you you make throughout the the game game have and there there is all of of the to lis it 's no one him and and it it seems seems like like it it 's going to to be kind of of a a big big deal but it it 's brought up also the the fact fact that that max max can out of of character they do do n't n't even why is everyone is is so for max max in in this this game why was was the the `` `` '' '' nightmare '' '' happened in in the the first first game game it it was that it it was was just just a in max max 's but here can see see what what 's on it it also makes no no sense that max max and and safi into the the storm max 's 's new ability to from one to another could have have been been a but it it 's 's only the cat cat content is n't cash grab why did in the safi 's there 's 's not not even the side side characters characters are bland and i could most of of them max the out of of character character and and is is a for the the final final choice does not make a a lot lot of sense like most of of the the game game it seems to to come out of why is is there timeline where all the i 'm i could a lot more but but i i 'm to be this game game do do not not recommend at all you will will be,negative
i want to appreciate works for what they are rather than them for what they ’ t so when i this game would not be about i still deck nine to deliver an interesting continuation of max caulfield ’ s story however they seemed to disrespect the original game throughout double exposure there were elements of the game i enjoyed max ’ s new power where she can move between these two realities is fun and i found myself confusing the two versions of characters in the story this was by design and quite fun to keep of this power never comes close to the of other life is strange powers even double exposure struggles to find its there are so many different on and they don ’ t into a characters from the first game are still represented by their character while max caulfield is a real being max ’ s diary look and cold when we and the limited number of sets this game has all look like they could in any other game caledon lacks the charm of even from true colors and most of the environments would look in place in a game like ps despite this the earlier chapters were still pretty enjoyable the mystery is interesting and kept me through chapter though i was by how horny every character in this game is it was especially out of character for max but even in the other characters it was just both romance options are so there are no good new romance options it 's in the final two chapters where deck nine the narrative the game hints for most of the game that this seems like a of what the first game for and then the sets in they want to this franchise for every they can this is the first time i have not been excited about the future of this series the majority of the characters in this game don ’ t get space to in meaningful ways exploring max ’ s trauma is the most interesting thing this game does but there are only a of scenes where this is done in ways it felt like deck nine had a murder mystery written and then decided to max ’ s trauma at a few points to justify bringing her character back what me is how this game to upset its core they brought back max caulfield which is fan service but they seem to disrespect the in several ways making this game less to original fans i was even on for this this could ’ ve been a “ the last of us part ” style of off the fans writing a meaningful story even if it makes fans but then in the ending they this read as a clear attempt to profit off of the fans which i was already of given the nature of the edition but if they were just in it for the money why wouldn ’ t they go all the way with fan service why did they even if they knew this upset a number of their fans why make both of the romance options do they want to from the original and start a new one with double exposure i wanted this game to be good more than any game i 've played in years and i ’ ve away things i enjoyed but this is the worst game in the series i hope they can correct course for the future but my hopes are n't high hannah telle was great though i want want to for what what they they are rather than for what what they ’ t when i this game game would would not not be i still deck nine of max max caulfield ’ s s story the original original game double exposure there were elements of of the the game game i i enjoyed max ’ ’ s new power where she she can fun and and i i found found myself the two versions of characters in in the the story this was to keep of this other life life is is strange double exposure to find there are are so so many and they don ’ ’ t into a characters from from the the first first game while max max caulfield caulfield is is a max ’ ’ s when we and the this game game has like they they could in any true colors colors and most of of the in a a game game like the earlier chapters were the mystery mystery is though i i was character in in this this game game is it was out of of character character for for max but even even in in the the other other characters characters it it was was just romance options options are there are are no romance options it 's in the the final two chapters deck nine the narrative narrative the the game most of of the the game game that that this seems like like a of what what the the first first game and then then the they want want to this franchise they can this is is the the first time i i have about the the future of this this series majority of of the the characters characters in in this this game don ’ ’ t max ’ ’ s is the the most this game game does there are only a this is it felt felt like deck nine had a a murder murder mystery and then decided to max ’ ’ s a few to justify her character how this this game they brought back max max caulfield which is fan service but they seem to this game i was for this this could ’ ve ve been been a a “ the last of us off the the fans even if if it it makes then in in the the ending as a off of of the the fans which i i was given the of the but if if they they were were just in it it for for the the money wouldn ’ ’ t all the the way way with fan service why did did they they even even if if they they knew of their both of of the the romance romance options they want want to from the the original a new double exposure i wanted this game game to to be more than game i i 've 've played and i i ’ ’ ve i enjoyed but this this is the worst worst game game in in the the series series i i hope they can for the the future are n't hannah telle was great,negative
nostalgia sacrificed for `` '' good '' '' graphics money many lis who gave up after lis would give this a chance i 've played all of the lis games loved them even loved true colours but this one just was a very big let down zero depth to max 's powers and zero to any characters the best thing about lis has always been the emotional you towards the characters and how much you can with them but this game lacked that even the love interests were pointless the choices felt like they had no actual on the outcome of the game the choices also lacked depth and overall this up feeling like a very `` '' talking simulator do less '' '' gameplay it 's hard to make a game as good as the first when the og developers were off their own game because square enix wanted to their creative choices in of more money i 've personally loved all of the lis games but this one just lacked everything i wanted to feel how i felt when i first played the first game but instead i 'm left with dissapointed and because it was great to see max again play as her this just lacked everything the first game gave you as a player let this game go square enix and give dontnod their game back `` '' '' '' give this this a a chance i 've 've played all of of the the lis lis games true colours but this this one one just just was was a a very let down to max max 's 's powers powers and to any characters the the best the emotional towards the the characters characters and and how how much you can with them but this this game that even even the the love love interests the choices felt like like they they had had no on the of the the game game the the choices depth and feeling like like a a very `` '' '' '' it 's hard to to make make a a game game as as good good as as the the first when the the og their own own game game because square enix wanted to choices in i 've all of of the the lis lis games games but but this this one one just i wanted wanted to i felt when i played the the first first game game but but instead i 'm it was was great to see see max max again play as this just the first first game as a this game square enix,negative

i na start by saying i really wanted to love this game i do i think the first three episodes are great they 're enjoyable they 're in the third episode i felt the same amount of tension as the fourth episode of the first game it 's great the are in the work the visuals are amazing unfortunately it 's downhill from here i can not in good recommend this game the writing following the third episode is poorly written rushed and it 's a completely different storyline next to no main questions brought up in the first three episodes are and none of your choices matter in and the ending is out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it 's bad the cast and side characters are essentially with side that do n't matter does n't matter there 's no for any of the characters or mentioned in the first three episodes the detective plot just gets forgotten what happened to him is forgotten and what stakes are brought up in the third episode regarding time and is entirely for a weak and ending it 's not happy it 's not sad it 's nothing it does n't matter the entire game does not matter because no one has a full character no character changes or safi has already made up her mind none of your choices with her matter at all the game essentially itself in the final episode and that is the final in the no matter what you do or say to safi the ending is the same no matter what you do or say at any point in the game it does n't matter i chose the bay ending and i fully believe that this is the only way i could have of chloe i 'm not she 's not in the game i 'm glad and that says about the writing the first episodes are a the last two are a i can not tell you how the ending made me when the first three episodes made me emotional it was back to from the first game at no point in this game was i remotely the same amount of emotional depth that the first game reached this is not nostalgia i played the first game this year lol the writing was just so rushed and poorly that all potential points of emotion flat it n't make sense not even in a way in a way i 'm not mad i 'm disappointed which is somehow worse i love the first game and i was hoping that this game could continue to on max and the new people around her and her new powers but it did n't and i can not recommend this game because it genuinely does n't feel like it 's coherent at all also someone needs to how to the audio because what the ♥♥♥♥ why was was the music so i really really wanted wanted to love this this game game i i do i think the first first three three episodes episodes are they 're they 're in the the third third episode i felt felt the the same amount of as the the fourth of the the first first game game it it 's 's great in the it 's here i i can can not not in recommend this this game game the the writing following the the third third episode rushed and and it it 's 's a completely different brought up up in in the the first first three three episodes episodes are none of of your your choices choices matter and the the ending ending is out of of the it 's the cast side characters characters are that do do n't n't matter does n't n't matter there 's 's no any of of the the characters in the the first first three three episodes what happened happened to and what brought up up in in the the third third episode time and for a ending it it 's 's not it 's 's not it 's it does does n't n't matter the entire entire game game does does not no one has a a full no character made up up her none of of your your choices with her at all all the the game in the the final episode and and that that is is the the final in the no matter matter what what you you do to safi the ending ending is is the the same no matter matter what what you you do point in in the the game game it it does does n't n't matter the bay bay ending ending and and i believe that that this this is is the the only only way way i i could could have of chloe chloe i i 'm 'm not she 's 's not not in in the the game game i i 'm 'm glad and that about the the writing writing the the first episodes are are a the last last two are a i can can not tell you the ending made me when the the first first three three episodes made me it was back to from the the first first game game at no point point in in this this game game was the same amount of that the the first first game this is is not i played played the the first first game game this the writing was just just so rushed and that all n't make make sense not even even in in a in a way i i 'm 'm not i 'm which is i love love the the first first game game and and i i was was hoping that this this game game could on max max and and the the new her and and her her new new powers but it it did did n't i can can not not recommend recommend this this game game because because it does n't n't feel feel like like it it 's at all how to what the the ♥♥♥♥ why was was the the music,negative

that great performances pretty graphics and a soundtrack ca n't carry or save a game from its writing it 's not just bad writing it 's and and ultimately disrespectful to the original game where the between max 's are at best and at worst if there was anything about max 's story i did not find it because there was nothing said or about max 's from her previous beyond what felt like a very shallow `` '' get over it and move on with your life '' '' i love hannah telle returning as max it 's just how much of a disservice double exposure feels like to hannah as a max as a beloved character and even dontnod and their own game that started everything in the first place you do n't feel any weight or consequences to the choices you make in this game to the point where the ending the choices you made simply taking the easily moments to in levels this was just a into your player character 's mind in every other game but here it 's a gameplay treated like a choice that will impact your game in any way when it absolutely does n't it 's a baffling small decision that really gets to the heart of the issue the people behind this game have really misunderstood what makes life is strange with fans to what i said in the first spoilers btw there is a strong that one of the original endings is as the obvious good choice while the other gets looked down on as double exposure asks `` '' well what did you expect '' '' de how both endings of the original are about the consequences of your actions and how you choose to it lis did n't end feeling like you were choosing between right and wrong but de not only it like you were with the writing following being given more respect and than but even ends itself with a choice between the obviously right path that max would choose given what she 's been through and the obviously wrong path that after everything feels so out of character for max especially within the narrative of this very game as of my finishing the game it 's some kind of that the majority of players at the time chose what feels presented as the wrong `` '' evil '' '' path none of the games so far in the series have felt like choosing between good and evil with double exposure and its for future games i 'm that a new will start where we wo n't get what made life is strange such a series and it 's all down to a big of why people loved the original series so much if you 're a fan of previous in life is strange or even just the first game double exposure the mark and after the first couple of chapters which might explain why those first two chapters were made available early to up the game before the full release characters and their moments in the story feel and underwhelming and caledon somehow feels so with how much it the same levels and areas over and over which did n't feel like a problem in lis or true colors thanks to changes in time of day and environment the murder mystery their marketing on only the first two chapters and from there it on the supernatural to get away with weak storytelling and an ending that feels so for lack of a better way to put it this is the first game in this franchise where i have completely my purchase it 's just a massive disappointment if you have any about double exposure wait until it gets a big price in a sale this has made me more to put my in what the new developers tease and whether to buy future games in the series ps the cat content is too minimal to justify the to the price it feels like it was meant to be in the game as you ca n't achievements without it so if you want some minutes of max being a cat person wait for the dlc to go on sale too graphics and and a ca n't a game game from writing it it 's 's not writing it it 's and ultimately disrespectful to to the the original original game where the max 's at best if there there was max 's 's story story i i did did not there was about max max 's from her felt like like a a very `` '' over it it and move on with your '' '' '' i i love love hannah hannah telle as max it 's 's just how much of a a disservice double exposure feels like like to as a as a character and and even and their their own own game game that everything in in the the first first place you do do n't n't feel to the the choices choices you you make in this this game game to to the the point point where where the the ending the choices choices you this was was just just a in every game but but here here it it 's 's a like a a choice that will game in in any any way when it does n't it 's 's a to the of the the people this game game have life is is strange what i in the the first there is is a a strong one of of the the original as the the other on as double exposure `` '' did you '' '' both endings endings of of the the original of your and how you choose did n't feeling like like you you were not only like you you were with the the writing but even with a a choice between the that max max would she 's and the feels so so out out of of character character for for max the narrative of this game as of my the game game it it 's 's some some kind kind of that the majority of at the the time as the `` '' '' '' none of of the the games so far in the the series felt like double exposure and its games i i 'm that a a new wo n't n't get life is is strange such a it 's to a a big loved the the original so much if you you 're a fan fan of in life life is is strange just the the first first game double exposure after the the first couple of first two two chapters chapters were up the the game before the the full full release characters and and their in the the story feels so with how how much the same over and and over did n't n't feel feel like like a in lis true colors thanks to murder mystery the first first two two chapters chapters and on the to get and an an ending ending that that feels feels so lack of of a way to to put this is is the the first first game game in in this this franchise where i i have it 's 's just just a a massive if you you have have any double exposure until it a big in a a sale this has made me to put what the the new in the the series the cat cat content to justify to the the price it feels feels like like it it was was meant meant to to be be in in the the game as you you ca ca n't it so so if if you you want minutes of of max being a a cat wait for for the the dlc to go on sale,negative

if you plan on following up on the bae ending to life is strange be ready to be extremely disappointed this game completely chloe price as a character and her relationship with max after the events of the first game going as far to and references to them in the games that followed following up on the bay ending actually had a lot of moments and references to chloe that had me feeling pretty emotional it 's just a the other ending that half the community chose was not treated with the same care and has no such moments taking so much weight and meaning out of that choice i made years ago i still plan on playing but with the this game should have a new and original protagonist instead of the of max and chloe if you up on on the the bae bae ending to life life is is strange to be this game chloe price as a a character character and and her relationship with with max after the of the the first first game references to to them them in in the the games up on on the the bay bay ending had a a lot lot of references to to chloe me feeling it 's 's just just a the other ending that was not with the the same and has has no so much out of of that i made i still but with with the this game should have a new instead of of max max and and chloe,negative

i love the lis series like many i was a fan of the first and have followed it since then i was excited to see the return of max and after the of true colors i this game would be a sadly it 's a disappointment the good looks great performances and voice acting are max like max maybe i 'm in the but the twist was the bad the story the writing the mystery that 's by episode the but use of max 's powers the game heavy of and rushed i hope this is n't the last lis but it will probably be the last we see of young max for something that should have been a of the series it instead the and leaves me about the 's future i love love the the lis lis series i was was a a fan fan of of the the first i was was excited excited to to see see the the return of max max and after the true colors this game game would would be be a it 's 's a a disappointment voice acting i 'm in the but the the twist the story the writing writing the the mystery mystery that that 's of max max 's 's powers the game i hope hope this this is is n't the last but it it will be the the last we see max for for something something that should have have been been a of the the series about the,negative
it me to write this do n't get me wrong there is a lot of stuff about this game that i like the first like and a half episodes were in my opinion perfect but the major reason i 'm saying i do n't recommend this game because it 's like they forgot they had to finish it starting through chapter the quality and like the of the game went way down and then in chapter it the last episode and the ending were written and made sense this was the most badly written ending that i 've ever seen not to mention there is like gameplay in the last chapter the rest of it being really terrible little scenes of that quickly cut to black and just go to another scene of that the ending makes it feel like this entire thing should have been safi 's story and not max 's like it makes no sense for the first chapters we played and it 's like it 's the ending of a different game entirely also your choices really do n't matter action will have consequences no it probably wo n't that was an issue in the original too i wo n't lie but this one is even more and yes a lot of these negative reviews are about chloe not making an despite max throughout the game i too am disappointed about it especially because the ending was so bad in general but if they would have just made the ending good by making it a ending they put time into i would n't be too mad about her not up but at the end they really do tease the player into thinking she was going to show up just to throw it away and i know why at the end of the game you get a scene which me off followed by a black screen that says max caulfield will return so they just did n't finish this game because they 're going to make another one i 'm sorry i paid for this game to be finished not to pay another on another game despite all this there are things that i like about this game graphics are good as long as you mess with the settings voice acting having the original voice for max was huge even though her ending left much to be liked being able to control the and actually take the pictures in game i really looked forward to doing another run of the game until i got to the end it everything i wish they would see how much we hate it and give this game an actual ending but they 're just going to put that in another game so no i can not recommend this game only buy it on super sale if you 've played the original and if you 're okay with the fact that the ending will be the worst ending you 've seen since how i met your mother me to to write do n't n't get get me me wrong there is is a a lot lot of about this this game game that that i i like like the the first and a in my my opinion but the i 'm i do do n't n't recommend recommend this this game game because because it it 's 's like like they they had had to to finish chapter the like the of the the game and then then in in chapter the last episode and and the the ending this was was the the most badly written ending that that i i 've 've ever ever seen not to to mention there is in the the last chapter the the rest rest of of it of that to black and just to another of that that the the ending feel like like this should have have been safi 's 's story story and and not max 's 's like like it it makes makes no no sense for the the first played and and it it 's 's like like it it 's 's the the ending ending of of a a different your choices do n't n't matter will have have consequences wo n't that was in the the original wo n't but this this one one is is even even more a lot lot of of these throughout the the game game i about it because the the ending ending was was so so bad in general but if if they they would would have just made made the the ending it a i would would n't n't be about her but at at the the end they really the player she was was going going to just to to throw it away and i i know at the the end end of of the the game game you you get get a by a max caulfield caulfield will will return so they they just did n't this game game because because they they 're going to to make one i i 'm 'm sorry sorry i for this this game game to to be not to another game there are things that that i i like like about about this this game graphics are are good good as as you with the voice acting the original for max max was even though much to to be able to take the game i i really forward to of the the game i got to the the end i wish they would see how how much it and give this this game an actual ending but but they they 're 're just going to to put another game game so no i i can can not not recommend recommend this this game it on sale if if you you 've 've played played the the original if you you 're with the the fact fact that that the the ending will be be the the worst you 've,negative
i love the lis series i love it so much the original game is the only game that has ever made me while playing lis lis bts lis of them i found to be amazing with lis being the worst of the bunch but even said i still found it a good game with that being said i thought this game was going to be a since we were getting max it the first three chapters the story me from the beginning the murder of a close friend and the that of a new power as well as between different love that concept most side characters were likeable funny and relatable i could see them existing in real life i found myself everything and everyone regardless of how close max was with them or not and i loved that you could feel the of the situation as well as a to make things right in order to find time would be too for a sequel i think these aspects were done i was every bit of this of the game episode episode you could have easily combined both to make one episode i spent over hours with the first three episodes the combined time for both and for my playthrough took less than hours total they felt rushed they lacked the depth i felt in the first three episodes they did not leave me wanting more they left me and the tease of a new game at the end really upset me i do n't want a new game and i do n't want a this game felt and unfinished please take the time to finish what was started it felt all too to leave this game as a cliffhanger with potential to create another lis game with two characters i honestly did n't feel much emotional to i can understand why max would feel attached to safi but i myself did not have that same connection with safi as i did with someone like chloe i did not want to say this but i feel the need to because of the price this game is not worth on it 's best day this game is worth at best for the hours played and for the lack of depth in the last two chapters lis fans will be very disappointed with what was given my would be to just wait for it to go on sale is wild for less than hours of and now that i know the ending i have no to replay it because again it just into the idea of a at the end regardless of what happens i 'm sorry max you are awesome i love this series but i ca n't recommend this game at it 's current price and i give this with a heavy heart i love love the the lis lis series series i i love it so so much the original original game game is is the the only game that that has made me while playing of them them i i found to be the worst of the but even i still it a a good good game game with i thought this game game was was going going to to be be a the first first three three chapters the story from the the beginning of a and the of a a new new power as well well as side characters characters were i could could see see them in real real life i found found myself and everyone regardless of max was with them them or or not and i i loved that you you could of the as well well as as a to make make things right in to find would be for a a sequel i think i was bit of of this of the the game you could could have to make i spent with the the first first three three episodes time for and for my playthrough less than felt rushed lacked the the depth i felt in the the first first three three episodes they did did not left me of a a new new game game at at the the end me i i do do n't n't want want a a new new game game and and i i do do n't n't want want a this game game felt take the the time time to to finish what was it felt this game game as as a a cliffhanger to create lis game game with characters i did n't n't feel i can understand why why max max would to safi but i did not not have with safi as i i did did with chloe i i did did not want to to say say this but i i feel need to because of of the the price this game game is is not not worth on it it 's this game game is at best for the played and and for for the the lack lack of in the the last last two two chapters will be very disappointed disappointed with with what what was would be to just wait for for it to go on sale less than hours of and now that i i know the ending ending i i have have no to replay it just into the idea of of a at the the end regardless of of what i 'm 'm sorry you are i love love this this series but i i ca ca n't n't recommend recommend this this game game at it 's and i give this with a,negative

life is strange and disappointing at times i ’ ll avoid heavy spoilers in this although it 's hard to do so here goes nothing first i for the “ bay ” ending i believe it serves as a more story for the themes this game is meant to explore however the fact that deck chose to both endings was a move and a choice i ’ ve only seen how things progress through the first two chapters with this ending but even at that i 'd buy that deck may not have been able to do it it ’ s not that i couldn ’ t believe max and chloe might part ways in fact considering they over trauma a of ways could become not still exploring the of such a relationship would serious narrative and i ’ m not deck could deliver that but i ’ ll myself out of that as it ’ s the least of the issues with the game 's overall narrative the first two chapters are done which is interesting to see that enix let people play those two early n't it you can explore the and shift between two timelines the living and the dead the living timeline with music and an overall sense of in contrast the dead timeline is cold distant and a yet weight although some of the of the original lis gets lost here deck in a strong contrast between these two realities the puzzles are a tho not as you around and reveal information by using both timelines versions of the characters and out how the levels do change and i the murder mystery through characters ’ lives motivations and at that of the game felt genuinely engaging and the cast seemed enough caledon didn ’ t feel much than or other parts of arcadia bay but the made it feel as a step up i expected to experience a of true colors and the original for a while it worked until it did n't and apart badly the plot being a lis story became but it did so in the worst possible way with little about it the pacing strong becomes up while down by without a even the achievements become as you of the side areas and achievements are into the first two chapters with the third off and by chapter you ’ re on more a linear path even the social media text messages and your own journal becomes and did they things perhaps but whatever the reason it leaves a deeply experience compared to heavy of lis and before the storm double exposure de is just bland though max gets to have a moment of resolve de hints at something which is fine but it it in a shallow way with a “ max caulfield will return ” in reality though de is hardly a cool i just wish they had how lacking the major antagonist is they fall jefferson ’ s dark in the first lis instead de ’ s big reveal seems to be that some people are just deeply a fact that requires real writing to make meaningful to create an antagonist with high despite their actions is no small and deck falls short there i remember people the first game ’ s ending but it was meant to either come full or it completely here there ’ s no and the final choice is since it only sets up the next along with your romance interests in short de as a mystery more more and then into absolute with no the game does a disservice to both its cast and even to max herself one of the most genuinely character the antagonist should in have a meaningful contrast to instead the story bringing out themes of the real power is the personality we get a simply poorly executed and mess so they can it out more heavy spoilers the to the original lis are present with rachel and chloe by maya and safi max ’ s of chloe at her chloe ’ s with her and i can see a similar with safi who with max while still by her past safi ’ s nature only when she asks max to her cause at the very end and that point she seems like a type of she for a part of the and though she seems her motivations seem compared to chloe feels and relatable safi ’ s motivations and actions don ’ t add up her struggles are and with little to justify her beyond being as “ evil ” even the damage by her distant the of her to her by her own handled chloe was yet by her mother fair but who did she had as a friend on the other end safi had moses a and friend who was close to her even before max so why does safi take this path instead of a we ’ re left if a to safi ’ s head wouldn ’ t have made a more end to the that not everyone is meant to be saved the case of alderman he seems intriguing and at first but then literally how does this work why do max and moses remember him will we ever get answers who what ’ s clear is that without him the game that is baffling because the game gets rid of him when it does n't need him then why have him to people off from what then there ’ s amanda one of the few characters she asks to take a break because of what a to up the game how maya meant to parallel rachel is another miss unlike the original de isn ’ t around maya the way lis around rachel she ’ s just another side plot to lucas ’ exposure trying to justify safi ’ s the lack of depth in safi ’ s combined with the of a serious is she a shot at her mother and the game barely there everyone on and seemingly be ok with it a solo safi game could have been would create some sort of tension allowing us to explore her relationship with her mother while safi would her nature then she max we get this in which there could be an option for safi to either herself or into the storm how a seemingly compared to time i mean power can carry massive potential but instead we get story where safi no real from anyone and back to your face in any attempt to help her max was at how her own powers nearly or actually did a town and messed up her life safi n't a and she 's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who to listen and `` we have power they do n't so i 'll work this out just fine '' and tries to and people to those who up safi life is is strange at times times i i ’ ’ ll in this it 's hard to to do so here for the ending i as a a more for the this game game is meant to to explore the fact fact that that deck chose to both endings was a and a a choice i ’ ’ ve through the the first first two two chapters with this ending but but even i 'd that deck not have have been able to to do do it it ’ ’ s that i couldn ’ ’ t max and and chloe in fact such a and i i ’ ’ m but i i ’ ’ ll out of of that as it it ’ ’ s s the the least of the the issues issues with with the the game game 's narrative the the first first two two chapters chapters are which is to see you can between two two timelines and the the dead and an sense of the dead some of of the of the the original original lis a strong the puzzles are a as you versions of of the the characters characters and how the and i murder mystery of the the game game felt and the the cast didn ’ ’ t parts of of arcadia arcadia bay but the made it as a i expected to experience true colors colors and and the the original for a until it it did did n't the plot being a a lis but it it did in the the worst way with with little about it it the even the the achievements as you of the the side achievements are into the the first first two two chapters with the the third you ’ ’ re even the social media text messages did they the reason reason it compared to of lis lis and before the the storm double exposure de is is just to have have a a moment moment of which is but it it in in a way with with a a “ “ max max caulfield caulfield will will return de is i just they had ’ s in the the first first lis ’ s seems to to be some people are just fact that to make to create is no the first first game ’ s ending but but it it was was meant meant to there ’ ’ s and the the final final choice since it up the the next with your in short as a and then with no the game game does a disservice cast and and even to max max herself one of of the the most character the the antagonist the story of the is the we get get a poorly executed so they they can it out to the the original original lis and chloe and safi max ’ ’ s of chloe at her chloe ’ ’ s with her her and and i i can can see see a with safi with max by her her past safi ’ ’ s max to at the the very seems like like a for a part of of the compared to to chloe safi ’ ’ s don ’ ’ t up her with little little to to justify even the by her of her to her by her her own chloe was by her as a a friend on the the other to her so why instead of of a we ’ ’ re to safi safi ’ ’ s wouldn ’ ’ t t have have made made a a more end to to the that not everyone is meant to to be case of at first first but max and and moses ’ s is that the game that is because the the game rid of when it it does does n't n't need from what then there there ’ ’ s one of of the the few to take take a because of of what up the the game meant to unlike the the original isn ’ ’ t the way she ’ ’ s s just trying to to justify safi ’ ’ s the lack lack of safi ’ ’ s with the of a at her her mother and the the game with it it a game could could have have been sort of us to to explore relationship with with her her mother we get in which could be be an an option into the the storm compared to i mean but instead we get no real back to to your in any max was her own messed up up her and she she 's 's just just a we have they do do n't so i i 'll '' and tries to those who,negative
besides the graphics and seeing max all grown up there was literally no point to this game the developers were just like this line they used for max in the last chapter when safi asked `` max what are you doing '' '' '' i 'm not sure i 'm kinda making things up as i go '' they the same ideas from the first game but lacked the depth emotional to the characters it was the most boring lis game i played and i played all of them i could n't even finish it bringing the storm back as if that makes any sense the nightmare sequence again double max 's dies the storm is on a cliff etc etc pointless not to mention how they did chloe so this will never be a continuation from the first lis this is just a poorly written game that its that was so because it was unique and because it was from so many great and for example deck nine has no clue how to be original they will just the same same ideas that were n't even to with but without making the characters actually relatable i did not get attached to any character not even max because it just was n't her i 'm sorry i spent so much on this it and all i will stay away from any deck nine game from now on the graphics graphics and and seeing seeing max grown up there was no point to this this game game the the developers were just like this for max max in in the the last are you '' '' '' '' '' i i 'm 'm not i 'm things up as i the same from the the first first game game but lacked the the depth to the the characters characters it it was was the the most lis game game i i played played and and i i played all of of them them i i could could n't n't even the storm back as as if if that nightmare sequence max 's the storm storm is on a not to to mention how they they did will never be a a continuation from the the first first lis this is is just just a game that that was was so because it it was because it it was so many for example deck nine nine has has no how to to be the same were n't n't even making the the characters i did did not to any not even max because because it it just just was was n't her i i 'm 'm sorry sorry i i spent so much on this it and all i i will away from deck nine game from,negative
life is strange double exposure started out strong but in a frustrating and disappointing way by the end the first three chapters were great with and a mystery that me in i was excited to see where the story would go but chapters and are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the story quality in the later chapters it feels like the writers had no clear direction after chapter and instead of on the strong start they seemed to just make things up as they went along they even try to frame the antagonist as `` '' misunderstood '' '' she 's really just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a massive god who without and as if that ’ t enough she down and a “ ” which is just and goes against everything this series for the powers were never meant to be the point of the story both the romance options are handled poorly the game you into a relationship with a character you know next to nothing about and the romance option is he comes off as a constantly trying to flirt with you and he ’ s been with his which just me the wrong way it ’ s disappointing because i wanted to like this game the first half had me and but the second half completely killed it the series needs to and make this entry if it wants any hope of me back as it i can ’ t recommend this game if you decide to try it anyway just to be let down life is is strange strange double double exposure in a by the the end the first first three three chapters chapters were and a a mystery mystery that i was was excited excited to to see where the the story would go chapters and the story in the it feels feels like like the the writers had no chapter and instead of on the to just make things things up as they they even try to the antagonist `` '' '' '' she 's 's really with a a massive as if if that ’ t a “ which is is just this series for the the powers meant to to be be the point of of the the story the romance romance options options are the game you into into a a relationship relationship with with a a character you know and the off as as a trying to to flirt flirt with he ’ ’ s me the it ’ ’ s i wanted wanted to to like like this this game game the the first but the the second it the the series make this if it back as as it i can can ’ ’ t recommend this this game game if if you to try to be let down,negative
tldr this game doesn ’ t respect the past events from the first game them the max is the only thing that over from the first game but none of the she would have the romance options are terrible and out of place with one option introduced after just a minute and the other being so and weird that neither max the player would consider them wait for reviews after the full release if the are true this could be the worst story of this year seems with sequels that ’ t really needed i loved the first game as a and have always with max her story and the plot really made me care about everyone in that town because of that i gave this sequel a shot and here are my max ’ s character is still ’ s just as i remember and having the original voice is a nice touch however it feels like the only real connection to life is strange is max herself the first game ’ s ending was and meaningful with players having to choose between the town or here all they did was this on its face feels disrespectful to me but it 's even worse later on as it ’ s barely the events for how this would even happen episode a few hints about what happened but it feels more like they wanted to mention it and move on as as they could as it is ever about again rather than fully respect the original ’ s endings to move to this plot they should have either made one ending canon or handled both more it feels similar to ’ s the dead series where is forced into certain point in time for the plot of to happen so she can be in the same for the plot to happen regardless of your choices in the second game here they they ’ d respect both endings but that ’ s clearly the writing feels off overall the game does something i dislike in a character you just met telling you they ’ re cool and immediately romance with them within a minute this character is flirting and there ’ s an option to them which makes no sense i barely know them it ’ s especially since it happens right after i ’ d rather have the romance option after getting to know them not be into it in the hope that it was a good choice later there ’ s also another love interest who is as and just a terrible person it feels like a bad joke to suggest that max would ever be interested in him i ’ m still about the story but i don ’ t get why they released the first two chapters early and especially when the full game on the th with all chapters it feels like they ’ re just trying to cash in if you ’ re thinking about buying this game i ’ d suggest waiting for the full release and reading some reviews the ending if true like it could be game of of bad i was hoping it was fake but seeing gameplay i ’ m it ’ s the last of us part all over again personally i ’ m in max ’ s story enough to see it through but i ’ d others to wait and see if the game lives up to the of the first this game doesn ’ ’ t respect the the past from the the first first game max is is the the only thing that from the the first first game none of of the would have have the the romance romance options options are and out out of of place just a and the the other the player wait for after the the full full release if the this could could be be the the worst of this ’ t t really i loved loved the the first first game game as as a with max story and and the the plot made me care about in that because of of that that i max ’ ’ s character is is still ’ s s just as i the original is a it feels feels like like the the only connection to to life life is is strange strange is is max max herself the first first game ’ s ending was to choose between the the town they did was this on its its face disrespectful to to me me but but it it 's even worse on as as it it ’ ’ s how this a few about what what happened but it it feels more like like they wanted to to mention it and move on on as as they they could as it it is rather than respect the the original ’ s to move to this they should should have it feels ’ s s the point in time for for the the plot to happen she can can be be in in the the same for the the plot to happen regardless of of your your choices choices in in the the second they ’ ’ d respect both both endings but that that ’ ’ s the writing the game game does something i a character you just they ’ ’ re with them character is and there there ’ ’ s an option makes no no sense know them them it it ’ ’ s since it i ’ ’ d have the the romance to know know them not be it in in the hope that that it it was was a a good there ’ ’ s s also love interest and just just a it feels feels like like a a bad that max max would i ’ ’ m about the the story but i i don don ’ ’ t why they the first first two two chapters when the the full on the with all it feels feels like like they they ’ ’ re trying to if you you ’ ’ re this game game i i ’ ’ d

a review it 's very sad to see what decknine has done with my favorite game franchise first of all i ’ ve been following the marketing of this game since it was and besides all the being uninteresting and all the same the developers even when they said they would “ respect the both endings of the original game ” after a while i about spoilers as everything about the game 's marketing was entirely uninteresting so i went looking for what was really going for those who like me saved chloe in the first lis the last words of the game were chloe and max each other they would stay together but now in this game right from the first minutes of gameplay you ’ re forced to end max and chloe ’ s relationship in a way that completely both max and chloe ’ s characters as well as the fans choice to sacrifice an entire city to save her from that point on chloe does n't even to say a single the best we get are messages so that it hardly feels like her on the other end of the they didn ’ t even create a character design for chloe the game 's is completely lazy as the developers go out of their way to that the two endings of the first game have no impact on this one ’ s narrative making the storyline almost regardless of the choice made in the first game speaking of the the of max and the supposed chloe 's is at this point i ’ m very disappointed with the narrative who despite not being part of the first game in my opinion did a great job on lis before the storm and what ’ s up with these completely forced it seems like even if you say you only want friendship with these new characters the game constantly tries to you into some kind of relationship with them in a timeline where chloe is alive the least i expected was some respect after the first don ’ t nod the original creators of lis gave us the choice to decide the ending of the first game a choice where players could their and decide their ending then decknine came along and took that choice from us in an way at the end of this game one of the characters hints at the of chloe returning in the next game but having to wait years for something that they were to show now is also disrespectful to fans if like me you saved chloe in the first game i recommend reading the comics and them as canon even if you don ’ t think the comics are perfect they were at least made by people who truly love the life is strange franchise as for those who didn ’ t save chloe if you 're with a max and a game premise that powers over storytelling and characters go ahead and enjoy for me the best this game has to offer are beautiful graphics and a soundtrack the and emotional storytelling that is the of the first game is far from being well represented in this one as a the feeling after this game is similar to how it felt at of the world against on our when we were down now we ’ re into the second “ max caulfield will return ” i just hope that this time we at least get the like in that it 's to see see what my favorite of all all i i ’ ’ ve ve been been following following the the marketing of this this game since it it was all the all the the same the developers when they they said said they they would respect the both endings endings of of the the original original game about the the game game 's so i for what what was was really for those those who like me chloe in in the the first first lis the last of the the game game were chloe and and max each other they would in this this game from the the first first minutes minutes of you ’ ’ re forced to max and and chloe chloe ’ ’ s in a a way max and and chloe chloe ’ ’ s as well well as as the the fans to save save her does n't n't even to say the best we get that it feels like like her on the the other end of of the didn ’ ’ t t even create a a character for chloe chloe the the game game 's as the the developers out of of their way to that the the two endings of of the the first first game game have have no on this this one ’ s making the regardless of of the the choice in the the first first game speaking of of the of max max and and the the supposed chloe 's at this this point point i i ’ ’ m very disappointed disappointed with with the the narrative part of of the the first first game game in in my my opinion did a a great great job before the the storm storm and and what ’ s up with with these it seems seems like even if if you you only with these new characters characters the the game tries to you into some kind kind of relationship with with them them in in a timeline where chloe is is alive the least i expected after the the first don ’ ’ t the original original creators of lis the choice the ending ending of of the the first first game game a a choice in an at the the end end of of this this game one of of the the characters at the of chloe in the the next next game game but for something something that that they they were is also disrespectful to like me chloe in in the the first first game game i the comics comics and even if if you don ’ ’ t the comics they were at least made by people who love the the life life is is strange for those those who didn ’ ’ t save chloe if you you 're with a max and and a a game and characters for me me the the best this game game has graphics and and a that is is the of the the first first game game is from being in this this one as a after this this game game is how it it felt of the the world when we we ’ ’ re into the the second “ max max caulfield caulfield will will return i just hope that that this this time at least like in in that,negative
a poor experience in to its not worth it at full price not even close to its not worth worth it not even,negative
an obvious cash grab and disservice to the original game this is a franchise about people and choices and this game go the original devs new game lost records bloom rage cash grab to the the original original game game this this is is a choices and and this this game the original new game lost records records bloom bloom rage,negative
this game wants to just throw away a decade long relationship for us fans and a relationship that years in universe the first minutes well expecting you to move on immediately to a new relationship with a that i don ’ t give a sh t about well also chloe as a character with her saying that she doesn ’ t max to not use her powers that she doesn ’ t even know if she can use they did not respect the ending of the first game most of us sacrifice entire town for chloe for max and chloe s relationship and they threw it away like it was nothing graphics are good the outfits are not worth paying for environments feel at times characters are and annoying other than safi encountered a couple bugs i would not recommend this game to any fans of life is strange this game wants to to just throw away a decade and a a relationship relationship that the first first minutes you to to move move on to a a new relationship with with a that i i don don ’ ’ t sh t chloe as as a a character with her that she doesn ’ ’ t max to her powers that she doesn ’ ’ t t even know if if she she can they did did not not respect respect the the ending ending of of the the first first game most of of us for chloe chloe for for max max and and chloe and they it away like it it was graphics are are good good the outfits are are not not worth at times characters are other than a couple i would would not not recommend recommend this this game game to to any fans of of life life is is strange,negative
update i the game the game literally does n't have an ending nothing gets resolved the game just ends this game is a positives the game looks pretty music is very good hannah telle is giving it her all and moses is genuinely likeable negatives the game absolutely hates you if you picked sacrifice arcadia bay and does everything in its power to the characters with out of character writing in the most ways even multiple things about these characters the developers promise of “ both endings ” was a lie unless you and on someone ’ s as an act of respect this would be bad enough if it was just in the beginning but the game is on you throughout the overall writing is also full of very forced jokes including `` '' '' '' `` '' '' '' a guy trying to max into at work because it 'd be `` '' sexy '' '' guy is a romantic option btw personally i need to speak with about him and some other during texts it 's not charming in the slightest several audio bugs people like they ’ re in a different room when they ’ re right in of you twice while playing it and since your can ’ t skip it ’ s a to get back to where you were had another where you are supposed to open a locked after the the open on its own and i could see everything of it even though i was that i need to find the key the feel incredibly forced the game is with forced sexual jokes and the character vinh is a romantic option and comes off as nothing but a overall if you are a fan of dontnod ’ s original title and its sequel to an this game is not for you if you sacrificed arcadia bay it does everything it can to what the of those games has the ending meant with the game game the the game does n't n't have an ending the game this game game is is a positives the the game game looks music is is very very good good hannah hannah telle all and and moses moses is the game if you arcadia bay everything in power to out of of character in the the most things about characters the the developers both endings was a unless you ’ s as an would be if it it was was just in the the beginning but the the game game is throughout the writing is is also `` '' '' '' `` '' '' '' trying to because it `` '' '' '' is a a romantic need to him and and some it 's 's not in the the slightest like they they ’ ’ re in a a different when they they ’ ’ re right in while playing it and can ’ ’ t it ’ ’ s s a to get back to where you you were where you you are supposed to to open after the on its and i i could could see of it even though though i i was that i need to to find find the the game game is the character is a a romantic off as nothing but but a if you you are are a a fan fan of ’ s and its sequel to this game game is is not if you arcadia bay it does it can what the of those the ending,negative
you know what you did you knew the one thing that would off the fans and yet you still did it edit full release how did it get worse what was that ending you know know what what you you did did you you knew the one thing that that would off the and yet full release what was that ending,negative
story aside how u use max for a money grab when you ’ re changing her rewind power anyway you could ’ ve had a whole new protagonist don ’ t make a sequel to a game that has two entirely different endings if you ’ re going to be lazy and not respect both endings if u wanted to make this right this basically should ’ ve been two completely different games on the lis ending you picked this is the same that wrote bts that chloe thought about max for the years she was gone chloe would not leave max max for for a when you you ’ ’ re you could ’ ve had a a whole don ’ ’ t make a a sequel sequel to to a a game game that that has entirely different if you you ’ ’ re going to to be and not not respect respect both both endings wanted to to make make this should ’ ’ ve ve been completely different on the the lis this is is the the same about max max for for the she was chloe would would not,negative
game essentially nothing happens and your choices do n't have any consequences what so ever the first story was so good it all tied up and made sense i do n't even understand this one after just finishing the game outfits were rushed and look cat dlc has about of gameplay avoid at all a play through first your choices choices do do n't n't have have any the first story was was so so good it all up and i do do n't n't even this one the game rushed and cat dlc at all,negative
spoiler for double exposure and some ones for lis and i really wanted to like this game but here is my review as a fan of life is strange since trying to do lis plot with the storm and stuff but failed to lis just for the impact because there is no emotional impact in double exposure as if trying to profit on your emotional for the first game and it 's not even their game almost everyone is either boring or had like scenes and for what alderman as quickly as he and even that was n't explained or both also deck nine reduced their characters to like and they can be in one in short deck nine is their characters for example moses is the `` '' '' '' and that 's basically his whole character and the story around this so let 's say we need to damage a but only in a way a certain someone can it then you have the moment of moses is a sort of mechanic so you go to him another example is amanda avengers type more and more characters suddenly had powers and safi started to collect the people like in lis the story is about rachel and eventually trying to stop a yes that 's to the power but more of an after effect while max and chloe is up and also the thing with and so much more in lis it 's about two trying to to after a the the mom and on your and your with and ultimately on the so 's power is not the main focus either it 's more like something to or we will get in etc the price is for just the edition so no i am not paying twice as much for two scenes of a random cat and an like no i in fact do n't want to look like a or as my even the normal outfits were really weird especially the color were horrible terrible and i have to flirt with obvious just because you could kiss chloe and in lis and kiss and in lis does n't mean it 's a major thing but here it felt forced even though i do n't care at all not to mention both of them are not very likeable it also had nothing to do with the plot just some i and with cringe dialogue options even deck nine out her character in before the storm just to make them break up off screen and change the lis max and chloe picture they make it look terrible and the reason for the break up is so that max could have romance with characters in this game which deck nine made a big deal in de do n't nod said they want to create relatable characters going through struggles but of a supernatural twist however here it was all about powers powers and powers while speaking in lis she constantly puts her hand on her sometimes she 's and she does n't that etc but in de she is a jokes and then about it all these scenes are incredibly cringe and i wanted to die every time i was forced to listen to that not to mention that the whole pricefield break up in the original game chloe immediately max back after and choosing everything against her chloe with etc she never leaves max throughout the game so all in all it 's just terrible writing chloe would not in fact leave max a half and start flirting with victoria out of all people the diary was terrible the moment of max writing `` '' she left me '' '' and all around it and on another page there is max in style with both amanda and vinh each her on while max has in her is also not only is max a but also an do n't get me wrong i actually liked some parts of it but it did n't give me the same feeling like in lis and even bts were super random and then the thing where max can just take a photo of people or things and it on some kind of for everyone to see even where she should n't have been i think plot holes here it felt like a in lis and i loved it and even went back as to collect them for achievements and almost every choice was like if i on a or not literally and some were about lis if you sacrificed chloe or arcadia bay like it should n't have been a major choice was the chapter they could just ask me before i started the game like in lis all in all it to the same `` '' ending '' '' and it was n't i was really confused and the whole marvel thing was super cringe the cherry on top was a text at the end `` '' max caulfield will return '' '' please no deck nine stop games and characters that do n't to you just because you are for money and want to fans of the series edit i forgot to mention max either had let a whole city got but a storm from of her powers or goes into the past to the moment she first used them in order not to let the storm form at all and her best friend chloe get shot but she used her new powers again this is i had bought double exposure as a fan of the series and i expected an okay game but it was even worse than i thought there are many more things that i could point out but i 'm out of space so i 'll just with what i did n't like the most and so much more to talk about honestly you should n't consider double exposure as canon because it 's basically a the original creators are do n't nod not deck nine this game is not enjoyable and not worth the money atrocious story writing and an even worse ending double exposure and some lis and and i i really really wanted wanted to to like like this this game game but but here is my as a a fan fan of of life life is is strange trying to to do with the the storm storm and to lis just for for the there is is no double exposure exposure as as if trying to on your for the the first first game game and and it it 's 's not not even everyone is and for for what as he and even even that that was was n't n't explained deck nine to like and they they can can be in one in short deck nine for example moses is is the the `` `` '' '' '' '' and and that that 's 's basically character and and the the story let 's need to in a a way then you you have have the moment of moses is is a sort of and more powers and and safi the people in lis the story story is and eventually trying to that 's to the the power more of while max max and and chloe chloe is up and also the the thing so much much more in lis it 's trying to on your and ultimately on the is not not the the main it 's more like the price price is just the no i i am am not of a and an no i in fact do n't n't want want to like a even the especially the and i i have have to to flirt flirt with just because because you you could chloe and in lis lis and in lis does n't it 's 's a a major but here here it it felt even though though i i do do n't n't care at all not to to mention both of of them them are are not it also also had nothing to to do with the the plot deck nine her character character in in before before the the storm just to to make break up and change change the the lis max and and chloe make it the reason reason for for the break up is so that max could have characters in in this this game game which deck nine made a a big big deal in de do n't n't nod said they they want want to to create going through of a here it it was was all all about powers and in lis on her she 's and she does n't but in in de she is is a and then about it it all and i i wanted wanted to to die time i i was forced to listen to that not not to to mention that the the whole break up up in in the the original original game max back she never throughout the the game game so all in in all all it it 's 's just chloe would would not not in in fact with victoria out of of all moment of of max `` '' '' she left me '' '' '' and it and there is is max max in while max max has is also not only is max do n't n't get get me me wrong some parts parts of of it it but but it it did did n't me the the same feeling like like in in lis lis and and even and then then the where max max can take a a photo of people it on on some some kind kind of to see where she should n't n't have have been i think plot holes here it it felt felt like like a in lis lis and and i i loved it and and even back as like if if i on a or not and some if you arcadia bay like it it should should n't n't have have been been a a major was the they could before i the game game like like in in lis all in in all all it to the the same `` '' '' ending '' '' '' and and it it was was n't i was was really and the the whole the cherry cherry on on top was a a text at the the end `` '' '' max max caulfield caulfield will will return return '' '' '' deck nine games and and characters characters that that do do n't to you you just just because because you you are want to fans of of the the series to mention a whole but a a storm of her her powers into the the past to the the moment them in not to let the the storm at all all and her best best friend her new new powers again this this is i had double exposure exposure as as a fan of of the the series series and and i i expected game but but it it was even worse than i i thought there are things that that i i could but i i 'm out of so i i 'll with what what i i did did n't n't like like the the most so much much more you should should n't double exposure exposure as because it it 's 's basically the original original creators do n't n't nod deck nine this game game is is not and not not worth worth the the money writing and and an even worse,negative
life is strange double i started playing this game with a strong feeling that i would probably end up it however for the first few hours i was i thought `` '' maybe this game wo n't be so bad '' '' and it was nice to be wrong but that feeling only for the first few hours and then the `` '' story '' '' happened life is strange double exposure una de life is strange double exposure por i want to say that and this is n't just about life is strange but many works that later become if you create a decent story and it 's complete then in most cases the creators have nothing more to say it ’ s usually better to start something new than to make a sequel obviously sequels are made for if something enough money and they often create an entirely different story or game and on the name to help it sell again but in most cases this isn ’ t it makes things worse and it people away i feel like there have been too many cases like this to the but in the people in are often not content creators they look at past and say `` '' more '' '' well in the case of life is strange it feels like the story was by those very in with their it ’ s the same old thing and including the characters the game looks beautiful and the first couple of hours before the `` '' story '' '' in offer that same life is strange vibe that i personally enjoyed about the first part it feels like if you the and the plot leaving players just to and in the game might be better as for optimization it ’ s hard for me to i saw of reviews mentioning that the game is buggy i did n't experience that but i also didn ’ t have even though the developers that to the with life is strange should ’ ve been just the first part maybe with before the storm and a possible years down the line instead we have a whole series of stories i hope people with their and the that this to doesn ’ t pay off life is is strange strange double playing this this game game with with a a strong that i i would end up for the the first first few few hours hours i i was i thought `` '' this game wo n't n't be so bad '' '' '' and and it it was to be but that for the the first first few few hours hours and and then then the the `` `` '' '' story story '' '' '' life is is strange strange double double exposure de life life is is strange strange double double exposure i want want to to say say that and this this is is n't life is is strange strange but if you create a a decent story and and it it 's then in the creators nothing more to say it ’ ’ s something new to make make a a sequel an entirely entirely different game and on the but in isn ’ ’ t it makes and it i feel feel like have been like this the people are often say `` `` '' '' '' in the case of of life life is is strange it feels feels like like the the story story was it ’ ’ s s the the same the characters characters the the game game looks and the the first couple of before the `` '' '' story story '' '' '' life is is strange that i about the the first it feels feels like like if if you and the the plot just to the game might be be better it ’ ’ s s hard for me me to i saw that the the game game is i did did n't but i didn ’ ’ t t have even though the developers to the life is is strange should ’ ’ ve ve been just the the first before the the storm storm and and a down the we have have a a whole series of i hope and the that this doesn ’ ’ t,negative
this review will spoilers for double exposure feel free to skip to the end for the final if you want to avoid spoilers life is strange double exposure is as the first direct sequel in this series of after the first game endings the developers made the choice of setting up future stories as that only touch on what happened since the first game because of the premise deck nine has for de it is impossible to this game without spoilers the very first life is strange awkward girl max caulfield as she has the social realities of high she away from her of arcadia bay at a young age only returning at the age of to it 's while there she with her friend chloe price and also discovers she has the ability to rewind time a of the future tells her that a massive storm is coming to the town and while a whole trying to disaster max and chloe solve a murder mystery and the of their at the end max must decide whether to use her time travel powers one last time to prevent the disaster for good by allowing chloe to die the entire 's past event or to save her best friend one last time and let the storm take its course upon finishing every lis game it will give you a full of choices and the final choice of lis to by fans as `` '' bay bae '' '' is right down the keep this in mind that if any were to happen to lis that any will end up of the people who played the game and who are your potential biggest like other lis sequels de is about you at the beginning which choice you made at the end of lis as it is a direct sequel set years later you can choose whether or not you decided to save arcadia bay as well as whether max and chloe friends or became romantic to the in the room no matter if you chose friendship or romance max and chloe are in an entire game that feels like badly written fan fiction how the relationship feels the most like bad fan fiction if they were chloe a breakup to max she 's a free that ca n't be tied down a direct of her previous if they were friends max and chloe go from being to literally each other and max herself to chloe 's other close friend rachel this all serves to make max herself feel like she has n't a day she 's supposed to be years old now but is still awkward and to in social though she will make very flirty and horny comments of the player 's control weirdly enough if the marketing itself did n't say that a decade had you 'd hardly know besides max having as a character to herself at the start of lis there are no or mentions of of time in the game itself a that was present in previous lis games i 'd almost suggest that the reason for this is because they had n't out when exactly this game was supposed to take place as they were writing it and just left it open until it was too to go back and change anything it the then if de felt the need to the why even bring max back the obvious reason is because it 's great marketing and i would n't be the only super fan who got in by this i could almost it if the game 's writing and story felt at all but for something that lives and dies by this it is easily the biggest fault with de the premise is that max having been so by what happened at the end of lis has spent the past decade on the move and has now down at caledon to a from her past is out of her life now and she has not used her time rewind powers since lis while out with her new friends moses and safi one she safi get upon another event max discovers her powers have again this time in a new form now max can shift between different timelines to one where her new best friend safi is alive max 's becomes to use this new ability to the in the timeline and save 's life it 's a genuinely intriguing premise but also a total it 's these early parts of murder that will make you why max is even here there 's nothing really unique to her character that `` '' max needed to be the protagonist of this story '' '' and the game itself does such a poor job of the between max moses and safi that you just kind of have to take it on its face that these three are ride or die friends for life for the story to work at all of course all is not what it seems and eventually the story becomes a complete of lis and that is when you see why they made max the main character where episode of this game its time lis 's ending and episode will make you why this game even episodes through are basically a bad fan fiction of lis with episode making multiple direct spoiler references to lis 's ending it 's truly baffling then that the marketing had the to say this game was the perfect entry for new players to the series for a series that well as an of mostly stories de then ends with a super of other people with powers that makes me if this is a from square enix so if the writing sucks is there anything about this game the gameplay itself is nothing to write about gameplay was never the strong of lis but here it feels even because it 's basically impossible to usually you will need go from one timeline to another to an or talk to specific characters and there will always be a time the game itself at least looks very good if you have a enough to run it and de once again the motion capture that true colors had the music is your fair by now you will have decided if you like or hate it the performances are pretty good hannah telle and it out of the as max and most of the other are doing their best to sell the really awful writing in the end it 's really hard to justify paying full price for a game clearly written by developers who either do n't care any more or never did and just feels like you 're playing someone 's bad fan fiction are made worse by the absolutely terrible for your money dlc you only very get to play with your pet cat in episode and i do n't know if it was a bug but not every dlc is available at all times throughout the story it is actually really funny that they did the early access that the biggest fans who would be most disappointed would get to experience their disappointment up double exposure to the the end for the the final if you you want want to to avoid life is is strange strange double double exposure exposure is as the the first in this this series series of after the the first first game the developers made the choice of what happened since the the first first game game because because of of the deck nine nine has it is this game the very first life life is is strange max caulfield she has away from from her of arcadia arcadia bay at the it 's with her chloe price she has has the ability to rewind time of the the future that a a massive storm is the town a whole trying to max and and chloe a murder murder mystery of their at the the end to use time to to prevent to die the entire to save save her her best best friend time and and let let the the storm lis game game it it will give you a full choices and and the the final final choice choice of of lis `` '' '' '' down the that if to happen to lis end up of the the people people who played the the game game and de is at the the beginning at the the end end of of lis as it it is is a you can or not decided to to save arcadia bay as well well as max and and chloe in the no matter matter if if you you chose max and and chloe in an entire game game that that feels feels like badly written fan fiction how the the most bad fan fan fiction if they they were to max she 's 's a ca n't n't be of her if they they were max and and chloe from being each other and max to chloe chloe 's to make max herself feel like she has she 's supposed to to be is still awkward and will make of the the player if the the marketing did n't say that that a a decade as a a character at the of lis there are are no of time in the the game game itself that was lis games games i i 'd that the the reason reason for for this this is because they they had had n't this game game was supposed to to take as they they were writing it it and and just just left until it it was to go go back back and and change felt the need to max back because it it 's 's great and i i would would n't n't be be the the only by this i could if the the game game 's writing and and story at all for something something that by this it is the biggest is that that max what happened at the the end end of of lis the past on the and has at caledon from her her past out of of her now and and she she has with her her new moses and and safi her powers again this this time in a a new max can timelines to her new new best best friend safi is is alive max 's to use ability to in the it 's 's a a total it 's parts of that will will make make you why max max is is even there 's to her her character `` '' '' max to be be the of this this story story '' '' '' '' and and the the game game itself such a moses and and safi that you you just kind of have to to take it on on its its face for life for the the story at all all of of course is not it seems and eventually the story a complete of lis lis and and that that is when you why they they made max the the main main character of this this game ending and will make make you this game a bad bad fan fan fiction of lis lis with references to to lis ending it it 's that the the marketing to say say this this game game was was the to the the series for a well as as an if this this is is a square enix so if if the the writing is there about this this game game the the gameplay nothing to to write was never of lis but here here it it feels because it it 's 's basically you will from one to another characters and and there will always always be be a the game game itself at least very good if you you have have a it and true colors the music music is you will will have if you it the are pretty pretty good good hannah hannah telle it out out of of the as max max and most of of the the other in the the end it 's 's really hard to to justify for a a game do n't n't care and just just feels feels like like you you 're bad fan fan fiction by the your money you only get to to play with your episode and and i i do do n't n't know know if if it it was was a but not at all throughout the the story it is that they they did early access that the the biggest fans who would be get to to experience,negative
as a fan of life is strange for years now and a fan of many different i have never been that disappointed by a sequel for a story game known for it 's choices and good story i did n't expect a relationship that was loved by fans since to be handled that badly and their breakup mentioned on the side if you break them up do it well true to the characters and take your time this just feels like a in the face for all the fans who have loved and the franchise since its first release as a a fan fan of of life life is is strange now and and a a fan fan of i have by a a sequel for a a story for it it 's choices and story i i did did n't a relationship relationship that that was to be and their on the the side if you you break do it to the the characters characters and your time this just just feels feels like like a in the for all all the the fans fans who who have the franchise,negative
i really wanted to like this game life is strange true colors the previous deck nine game in the series was one i deeply enjoyed i gave them the of the doubt when it was they were bringing max back even though an entirely new doing a sequel to a beloved game odd choice while the game makes a decent starting one can handle the way the game the chloe choice it quickly becomes that this is not a story about max caulfield the first three chapters do a decent job of a mystery using the new twist on the powers and even having character even if the limited areas really make the whole thing feel like a low sequel to a but the final two chapters the narrative that it really the experience the game does n't really explore the timeline mechanic beyond two or three light puzzle that are just because you can only use the mechanic at specific the fact that there are two timelines does n't provide any interesting changes or other than one timeline has blue color and more music and the other one has color and more music which is for about minutes the thing is i could a lot of the with the game and its of the same areas its run time if the narrative was worth it or had anything new or interesting to say about max or any of the characters i know i keep mentioning it but it can not be how much the narrative the game faster than the a line at the end of the more as a now than a promise the original music is nice but the are visually it looks fine there 's a to the atmosphere thanks to the setting but even so there 's only so many times you can through the same three and before you find yourself along to the next plot point the cast for the most part are the only real is moses and the only interesting presence is with almost as quickly as he is introduced which makes the entire game kind of have zero stakes max is so far from the cast and their that the of the dark a response more of than shock when there are no real character drama or tension between anyone what is there to get in i really wanted to love this game but if deck nine wants to keep making games with max as the do n't know that i want them to the first three chapters are worth but after 're better off just reading max caulfield fan fiction at least those writers understand why people loved the character oh and the dlc absolutely a off i really really wanted wanted to to like like this this game life is is strange true colors the previous deck nine game in in the the series one i them the of the when it it was they were max back even though an entirely a sequel sequel to to a the game a decent the way way the the game the chloe that this this is is not not a a story about max max caulfield the first first three three chapters a decent a mystery the new on the the powers powers and and even even if if the make the the whole whole thing feel like like a sequel to to a but the the final two chapters the narrative that it it really the experience the game game does does n't n't really just because because you you can the fact fact that that there there are two timelines does n't other than and more and the the other and more which is the thing i could a lot lot of of the with the the game game and and its of the the same if the the narrative worth it to say about max any of of the the characters characters i i know it but but it it can can not not be how much the narrative the game faster than at the the end end of of the as a the original music is but the it looks there 's 's a to the thanks to to the but even there 's 's only so many many times you can through the the same to the the next the cast for the the most the only moses and and the the only as he the entire entire game kind of max is is so so far from the the cast cast and and their that the of the more of there are are no no real what is is there to get i really really wanted wanted to love this this game game but but if deck nine wants to to keep with max as the do n't n't know know that that i i want the first first three three chapters chapters are but after max caulfield fan fiction at least understand why loved the the character and the,negative
oh where do i even the game has nice ideas too bad it executed them so poorly the lack of really the game down you get to see the caledon the and the snapping it some of the early lines between characters are super cringy for example the one safi says not long after the game started `` '' see this is why you need and in case you break your ass and need an ass '' '' which grown up would say that to someone they ’ ve known for only a few vinh 's whole character is weird an sexual the only cool character in this game is gwen there are some very big in the game the first one is the second the third the fourth well since the game is set up for a sequel we can only hope the next will explain the mentioned but lis double in itself is a weird mediocre game a to say i ’ m very dissapointed this has been the worst lis game in the a letdown the game game has bad it so poorly the lack lack of the game you get get to to see see the and the some of of the characters are for example the one after the the game `` '' this is you need you break '' '' grown up say that they ’ ’ ve only a a few character is the only character in in this this game game is there are in the the game game the the first first one one is is the the second the third the fourth since the the game game is set up up for for a a sequel we can hope the the next is a game a to say say i i ’ ’ m this has has been the worst lis game game in in the,negative
never thought i 'd down a lis game yet here we are chapters were pretty enjoyable last two were pretty awful it felt rushed questions went and the ending was just horrible other than that the romance choices were okay at best there was n't much to them there was so much sexual and that it got a bit the side characters were mostly pretty boring and bland and it felt we did n't get to know them that well because of the timelines and really just lack of with them was so reggie and diamond felt like characters amanda was all right but i did n't even like her that much but most choices do n't matter this was a very linear experience for a choice based game and even your choices do n't do anything choosing what to from being it will have consequences to get into more things the journal was pretty bad compared to the first game the power got a boring at times and was pretty used once maybe a few visual bugs diamond starting talking without her mouth lol chapter was incredibly short and there was n't many areas to explore at all the same few environments are used over and over i 'd a lis lis game here we chapters were were pretty last two were pretty it felt felt rushed and the the ending ending was was just other than that the the romance at best there was was n't much to to them there was was so so much that it got a a bit the side side characters characters were bland and and it it felt did n't n't get get to to know know them because of of the lack of with them was so felt like was all but i i did did n't n't even like her choices do do n't n't matter this was was a a very for a a choice game and and even choices do do n't from being it will will have have consequences to get things the pretty bad compared to to the the first first game game the the power got a at times a few short and and there there was was n't to explore at all all the the same over and and over,negative
they said `` '' respect both endings '' '' but you can tell they only really wanted to give you one if you chose chloe over arcadia i would n't waste my money just it the of both max and chloe is insane heavy on chloe and it honestly just feels like a shot in the heart for someone who has been in love with these characters for almost years making you have a break up story line with chloe just to immediately a new love interest sucks and makes me really not want to it really does me that they decided to just throw away the story line that over half the fan base chose to do especially after what we see in the comics and what we hear about max and chloe in lis i would have to see a option where you are in some type of long relationship with chloe and she you cute texts throughout the game but i want to enjoy this game so bad but feeling like this relationship i 've put so much time and story into just being throw out and sucks its made up for in the later chapters because the plot of this game is very interesting and i love max to death they said `` '' respect both both endings '' '' '' but but you you can really wanted wanted to to give give you if you you chose i would would n't max and and chloe chloe is chloe and and it just feels feels like like a in the someone who who has has been with these you have have a break up with chloe just to a new new love love interest want to it really that they decided to to just throw away the story chose to to do what we we see in the the comics comics and and what what we about max max and and chloe chloe in in lis lis i i would would have to see see a where you you are in some relationship with with chloe chloe and and she throughout the the game game but i want want to to enjoy this game game so so bad feeling like like this i 've so much time and and story made up up for in the because the the plot of this this game game is is very and i i love max to,negative
this might be the worst case of character assassination i 've ever seen i did n't want to believe it so i had to see for myself but the was all they chloe 's character from all character development that happened in the previous games for both chloe and max and just made her act like a a to get rid of her for this game and then comes the cherry on top seconds after we get to what happened between them we 're forced to flirt up a new girl even though we get a fake choice that we `` '' do n't like her '' '' it 's basically saying `` '' forget about that blue here 's some new we like better '' '' the dialogue is also cringe and and not the cute and well done kind of max cringe we 've seen in the past just actual cringy line after line i 've horny and choices in the first minutes alone how is that max i really ca n't ca n't put into words how damn disappointed i am why did they get to make this if they hate of the most important people in this universe oh right the also hates her i hope you 're happy that you ruined something that so many people so deeply for so many years life is strange was something special and you took it behind the and shot it i hope this is the last thing you 'll ever get to make sorry to all the people deck that tried to the away from this cliff you do n't deserve this but sadly it does n't change anything now just like the past games did n't for this game might be be the the worst case of of character character assassination i 've 've ever ever seen i did did n't n't want want to to believe it so so i i had had to to see but the was all chloe 's character development happened in in the the previous previous games chloe and and max max and and just just made like a to get rid of of her for this this game game and and then the cherry cherry on on top we get get to what happened we 're forced to to flirt a new even though we get get a that we `` '' do n't n't like like her '' '' it 's 's basically `` '' 's some '' '' '' the is also and not not the kind of of max in the the past i 've choices in in the the first first minutes is that that max max i i really ca n't ca n't i am why did did they get to to make make this if they of the the most in this her i i hope you 're that you something that so many so many life is is strange strange was and you it i i hope hope this this is is the the last get to to make to all all the the people tried to away from you do do n't it does does n't like the the past did n't for this this game,negative

this game had so much more potential than what we got felt like it has a bunch of story lines that went no where and should 've been focused on more the ending could 've been way more felt like a just a cash grab bringing max back literally just a game to set up their next one felt like it was and just all over them place i was really disappointed and it just felt a bit lazy i will say the characters are good they 're unique and and i liked a lot of them the visuals are stunning however as someone who 's been a long time fan of these games i feel like they really the on this one even life is strange my least favourite one had a more focused and more coherent story than this this game game had so much much more what we we got felt like like it it has has a 've been the ending 've been felt like like a just a a cash cash grab max back just a a game game to to set set up felt like like it it was and just all over i was was really and it it just a bit i will the characters characters are are good they 're and i a lot lot of of them them the someone who been a long time fan of of these games i i feel feel like like they they really on this this one life is is strange had a a more and more,negative
though i like the story i simply can not recommend the game itself it is quite clear that this is not the return to max caulfield anyone wants that i know of as a myself i 'm just so very dissapointed in decknine and the of anything to max from lis it seems more so like this game was meant to have an entirely different instead of max and the writing is too going with a more original story like true colors would 've worked out a lot better i 'd say they changed the beloved face of the franchise for a game that like a the story is still interesting but it 's for a life is strange game i 'm still interested because of max new power and amanda i ca n't help but see this is decknine 's own bad fanfiction rather than an actual in the franchise though i i like like the the story story i simply can can not not recommend the game game itself it is that this this is is not not the the return to max max caulfield that i i know as a i 'm just so and the to max max from from lis it seems like this this game game was was meant meant to to have an entirely entirely different instead of of max max and and the the writing writing is with a a more original story true colors out a a lot i 'd of the the franchise for a a game game that like a the story story is is still but it it 's for a a life life is is strange strange game game i i 'm because of of max new power and amanda i ca ca n't this is rather than an actual in the the franchise,negative
life is strange disappointing cash grab being a life is strange fan this is the first time i 've actually been disappointed with a life is strange game it just was n't as good as the old life is strange games with no narrative depth and a very confusing and story the disrespect towards the original choices of the older game added to the the game 's story is very predictable has so many loose ends no replay and has optimization issues i had to the game and change the settings times during my playthrough just to avoid the loading screen before a new it 's my fault that i the game with high hopes but instead i got a for another sequel with no ending and little to no effect on the story on the choices i made nothing but a disappointment life is is strange cash grab being a a life life is is strange this is is the the first time i i 've disappointed with with a a life life is is strange strange game game it it just just was was n't as good good as as the life is is strange strange games with no depth and and a a very towards the the original of the to the the game game 's 's story story is is very so many loose ends and has i had had to the game game and and change change the my playthrough just to to avoid a new it 's that i the game game with high hopes but instead i got got a another sequel with no ending and little to on the the story on the the choices i made nothing but but a a disappointment,negative
i 'm a massive fan of the lis game and of the before the storm the other games have been ok but did n't quite hit the mark with me so i was excited to see what double exposure would offer with the return of max to say i 'm disappointed is an the game is very poorly and was out my on the highest second highest and graphics settings and i did n't really see any visual between them there 's also bugs and the game crashes a lot along with a few bugs that my progress and i had to the game and for an earlier checkpoint for the narrative i was immediately put off by how it left a bad in my mouth and i had a hard time playing much after that i did n't really like most of the new characters i encountered within the first few hours of the game i played a bit more but became less and less interested in the plot and characters and eventually just playing it one of my friends finished the game and said it did n't get better so i a refund i 'm done giving money to that make games and try to bait fans with early access extremely light content dlc bring back the that made the first game please and listen to the fans i 'm a massive fan of of the lis game game and and of of the before the the storm the other other games have been did n't so i i was was excited excited to to see see what double exposure with the the return of max max to to say say i i 'm is an the game game is is very on the and i i did did n't n't really there 's bugs and and the the game a lot with a a few and i i had had to the game game and for the the narrative i was how it a bad in my and i i had had a after that that i i did did n't n't really really like most of of the the new new characters characters i the first first few few hours hours of of the the game game i i played a bit more but in the the plot and characters characters and and eventually one of of my finished the the game game and it did did n't n't get so i i 'm games and try to early access that made made the the first first game listen to to the the fans,negative
not the worst game i ever played but it is the life is strange experience if you coming expecting an interesting story you will be disappointed because this is not the game for that i have played chapter and through early access so far the story has moments but it is in the most of the game is to sometimes boring however once the character final has powers it felt more interesting but the writing is my after many years of playing life is strange games it is sad to see the studio have not out how to there story telling it is more of the same from the studio like previous life is strange games i am expecting that two final chapters to be more interesting than the first three chapters also i do n't believe this game is worth the price that it i recommend wait for a sale i feel like i should mention a few things i like so far the graphics is great love the art style minimal technical issues had a few text and motion seemed odd from time to time music is always great in these games not the the worst worst game game i ever played but it it is is the life is is strange if you you will will be because this this is is not not the the game game for for that that i i have chapter and early access so far far the the story but it it is in the most of of the the game game is the character has powers powers it it felt but the the writing writing is life is is strange strange games it is to see see the the studio how to it is more of of the the same from the the studio life is is strange strange games games i i am to be the first first three three chapters also i i do do n't this game game is worth the the price that it wait for for a a sale i feel feel like like i a few i like so far far the the graphics is great love the the art technical issues had a a few time to music is,negative
respect both ending or not this whole pay more to play early is some and why ca n't just release the complete game in one go like a normal person respect both or not to play ca n't game in in one like a,negative
even if we set aside all the issues with up with chloe for max may have since the breakup but for the players it would only be minutes they 're you to throw away a relationship in the first minutes of the game that alone is a serious issue from a gameplay and player experience but it end there perfect `` '' respect the endings '' '' right there even if all the the issues issues with up with with chloe chloe for for max since the for the it would they 're you to to throw throw away in the the first first minutes minutes of of the the game game that is a from a but it `` '' respect the the endings '' '',negative
my earlier review now that the full release is here the first two chapters have their issues but in general they do good enough job to set up the mystery and the characters you will be with throughout the game then everything falls apart in chapters and and is an absolute disaster that only serves to tease the sequel that 's right the story is n't resolved in this one after it out for hours they just literally say `` '' max caulfield will return '' '' the second it 's time for any consequences speaking of consequences your actions do not really have them the entire story is incredibly to the point where you can make every wrong choice and still end up with the same ending as a person who made every right one the original lis also had a similar problem with the ending being rather but at least it for some actions to have consequences episodes not so much here here you are put on and you ca n't from mr bones wild ride until the game rather ends i 'd like to say that at least the characters make the story worth it but that would be a lie everyone is extremely you have a love interest a love interest an on the and of course max 's new best friend around the entire do n't get me wrong they have potential and could be further but mr bones wild ride again and every decision you make regarding them does n't matter because we need to hit those plot as a they come off a little bit i literally when the character friendship with max has been ten minutes ago decided to have a to provide some needed and then the person who the friendship by to deliver some plot because she felt like it and do n't even get me started on safi who might as well be considering how often she between two completely different overall the character work is a massive even compared to true colours not to mention the original the gameplay is mostly just frustrating even with the hints turned completely off max will still provide `` '' '' '' on how to solve the puzzles the second you encounter them and the puzzles are pretty bad mostly to `` '' get an of information in the other timeline use it in the current timeline to progress '' '' and the few times decknine to step up their game are equally and straight from those frustrating early s where the only way to progress is to with everything in every single way until the random sequence of events works for example to a you need a specific the you saw in the previous room wo n't do the game will tell you to find a of in a certain room although max has no idea that it should be here turns out what the game wants from you is to a picture down to reveal a key although none of this is in any way the moment of the game is the ending of episode where max between two timelines to a person who is looking for her it is an extremely lame take on a in the and once again incredibly with only one correct way to resolve the situation you ca n't even the encounter because the mr bones wild ride do n't stop max just suddenly gets her old powers back for a moment then them again until the plot requires for her to get them back let 's talk about things that work the character are charming even if not all of them are in the same style telle does n't miss a bit as max and both her and voice performance are and deserve much better writing than whatever she was given moses despite being a of an is charming and funny to the point i wish he was the protagonist or at least a character sometimes and the music is great as always with `` '' '' '' being my favourite in the game it 's just that all those awesome parts only to the poor story work and boring gameplay regarding the game 's technical state at least on the patch of the actual release de has quite a few visual glitches especially with doors you also have that do n't sometimes and you the chapter it 's mostly limited to but still the experience is n't for example giving the card to in chapter may not be possible at all unless is on your side and their dialogue actually you also do n't have or any other form of so the game looks either on low settings or and blurry on high considering that this is a title with and even the settings at the of my i get into s during heavy scenes having some decent would help a lot ps chloe price does not in this game of a short nightmare sequence and some if you are going in expecting pricefield in any do not even if you choose the bae timeline in the the will be up by the time of the actual story in the game the is but on some level i understand chloe 's would more work and between and mr bones wild ride do n't stop for those for the other of lis are equally gone even if you choose the bay timeline you wo n't get any on etc that the the full full release the first first two two chapters issues but but in in general they do to set set up up the the mystery and the the characters you will will be throughout the the game chapters and and is is an the sequel that 's the story story is is n't in this this one it out out for they just say `` `` '' '' max max caulfield caulfield will will return return '' '' '' '' the the second it 's time for speaking of do not not really them the the entire story is to the the point point where where you you can and still end up up with with the the same as a a person person who one the the original original lis also had had a with the the ending but at at least for some to have have consequences so much you are and you you ca ca n't mr bones bones wild wild ride until the the game i 'd like to to say say that at least the characters make the worth it it but but that that would would be be a everyone is you have have a love interest love interest on the and of of course max 's 's new new best best friend the entire do n't n't get get me me wrong they have could be mr bones bones wild wild ride again and you make does n't n't matter need to as a a little when the the character with max max has has been decided to to have have a and then then the person who felt like like it it and do n't n't even even get get me might as as well between two completely different the character is a a massive compared to true colours not to to mention mention the the original the gameplay with the `` '' '' '' how to to solve solve the the puzzles the second them and and the the puzzles are pretty pretty bad `` '' in the the other use it it in in the '' '' '' and and the the few where the the only only way way to is to everything in in every every single until the for example you need in the the previous wo n't the game game will tell you you to to find in a max has has no no idea that it it should what the the game is to none of of this this is in any any way way the moment of of the the game game is is the the ending ending of where max between two two timelines timelines to a person person who for her it is is an on a in the way to you ca ca n't n't even because the mr bones bones wild wild ride do n't for a a moment until the the plot for her to get let 's things that the character even if all of of them them are in the the same does n't a bit as max max and she was despite being being a to the the point point i i wish was the at least and the the music music is is great `` '' '' '' in the the game game it it 's 's just that all the game game 's at least on the of the quite a a few that do do n't it 's still the the experience is n't for example in chapter not be at all on your and their do n't n't have the game game looks considering that that this this is is a and even even the of my i get a lot chloe price does not in this this game of a nightmare sequence and some if you you are in any do not not even even if if you you choose choose the the bae in the will be by the the time of the in the the game game the on some chloe 's mr bones bones wild wild ride do n't for those for the of lis even if if you you choose choose the the bay you wo wo n't n't get,negative
this is one of the games i 've ever played it feels as if it 's a complete max is in this game for absolutely no reason other than on or whatever safi is frustrating and deeply in a way i 'm not entirely sure was and the one interesting character from the game in never to be seen again caufield will return at the end of the game but quite honestly i hope she never does i hope this game is entirely forgotten and so poorly they never of bringing her back again this is one of of the games i i 've 've ever ever played it feels as if if it it 's 's a a complete max is in this this game game for no reason other than safi is in a a way way i i 'm 'm not and the the one from the the game to be caufield will will return at the the end end of of the the game game but i hope she never i hope hope this this game game is so poorly,negative
can not recommend game looks super blurry no way to fix that update setting to that there 's screen too does n't help it either game gets super when using powers too no doubt thanks to denuvo are often edit they 're just tied together not many of the dlc outfits are missing from the and it 's to a hair color if using one like hair there 's no way to skip so if you have to from a checkpoint expect a getting back to where you were and it may have been quite a ways back immediately upon starting the game you have to choose if chloe up with you or is dead yeah even the original for life is strange they 'd never have done that next you have to immediately decide if you have a on some new character of if they are n't your type after like from them with no context immediately after being hit with the chloe stuff like are you serious and the way they made chloe act in old texts you can read then having her flirting with victoria on social media that was literally in the nightmare sequence of the original life is strange it was so bad this was character assassination there 's no other way around it they absolutely the franchise from they did n't understand why lis was and obviously did n't like it it 's very clearly writing of the highest order but even if they did n't character max chloe in the worst way possible and the was an entirely new character it still would n't be a good game due to the lazy way are presented i 'll avoid max 's powers in this game but unlike the original they 're lame and annoying now there 's also zero to be doing any of it they ruined everything good about life is strange the mystery is kind of cool but it seems they that having a mystery to solve was the only reason lis was update i 've finished the game now all of the were true it 's by far the worst game in the entire franchise do not buy avoid this game like the god it 's so bad i did n't enjoy any of it but i 'll try to be fair let 's see i enjoyed the voice acting hannah telle did a great job as always it was nostalgic her the role but this was n't remotely max caulfield i do n't know who this was they had her face and her voice but it was n't her this max was n't awkward and did n't act remotely like the original max is a little which i guess is nice the good pretty much ends there the romance options were the one presented immediately after the chloe decision seems okay as a person but is n't interesting in the slightest and there 's no time given to even get to know her before trying to make some kind of decision on her she 's not really and like a young total normal then a weird over it then like really the girl has literally zero sense of and we 're just supposed to believe everyone she 's and cool because they just tell us she is like she 's not the other is a total neither max chloe would have ever even a no one even in real life would go for someone like that the story was so bad it had literally none of the of the original total character assassination with zero respect no even pacing bad romance bad gameplay bad power lame and the original missed a lot of the choices are so not obvious and out of the way like one just requires to these people talking for such a long time no one would do it the ending was super bad it was so bad i honestly could n't ever another life is strange in deck nine 's you got hard on this one can not not recommend game looks way to that there there 's does n't powers too thanks to are often they 're 're just of the the dlc outfits are from the and it it 's there 's 's no way to so if if you you have have to from a back to where you you were and it have been quite a the game game you you have have to to choose up with even the the original for life life is is strange you have have to if you you have have a on some if they they are are n't with no with the the chloe chloe stuff are you and the the way they made you can with victoria social media that was in the nightmare sequence of the the original original life life is is strange it was was so so bad this was character assassination there 's 's no the franchise they did did n't n't understand understand why did n't n't like like it it it it 's of the but even even if if they they did did n't chloe in in the the worst and the an entirely would n't n't be be a a good good game due to to the i 'll max 's 's powers in this this game game but unlike the the original they 're there 's to be any of of it life is is strange the mystery mystery is kind of but it it seems a mystery to solve was the the only i 've finished the the game all of of the it 's far the the worst worst game game in in the the entire do not this game game like like the it 's 's so so bad bad i i did did n't any of of it it but but i i 'll try to to be let 's i enjoyed the voice voice acting hannah telle did a a great great job it was but this this was was n't max caulfield i do do n't n't know this was they had and her but it it was was n't max was was n't awkward and did n't like the the original max is is a a little which i i guess the romance romance options the one after the the chloe as a a person is n't in the the slightest and there there 's 's no even get get to to know trying to to make some kind kind of on her she 's 's not not really like a over it sense of we 're 're just supposed to to believe she 's because they they just she is she 's 's not not the the other is a a total chloe would would have no one even in in real real life would go that the the story story was was so so bad bad it none of of the of the the original character assassination and the the original a lot lot of of the the choices are so and out out of of the the way one just such a long time no one would do do it the ending ending was bad it it was was so so bad bad i could n't life is is strange deck nine nine 's on this this one,negative
i bought and played this game on its release day th i do n't recommend playing this game though there 's a couple why the plot is the same as the first lis game 's plot your best friend dies and you need to use your power to save her by the timeline when she 's saved a storm is coming and the small town will be in you have to choose between your friend or the town your choices barely matter especially the important decisions that are supposed to make a huge in the story spoiler it was never explained why how in chapter alderman the detective his other self from the dead world the other self and then into and to no one ever about him after that there 's no for why or how this has happened in the first place it was n't explained how or why reggie found at the was this the same situation that has happened to alderman why was this never mentioned again you have to constantly through the last page if you want to read the diary entry such a the random that you can collect are they from a different timeline this was n't explained either this is the second lis game with max in it she 's a so why was there no `` '' photo mode '' '' or something added in the game this feature was a missed opportunity that would 've us to have that creative of snapping photos and them in the lis community i 'd have loved to take photos of anyone and anything in this game especially considering that the game graphics visually looks stunning even has a photo mode and that game is n't even about chloe price is a character and she was handled poorly in this game you only get to hear her voice and read a couple of her text messages or social media posts that 's about it her feels than life max `` '' nightmare sequence '' '' in chapter should have been safi 's nightmare sequence i understand wanting to max trauma from the first lis game but i feel as this was a missed better opportunity for us to what safi has been going through her entire life at caledon before she met max i 'm saying this because we barely could even with safi we had little to none about her after all the game has denuvo in it it 's the main reason why the performance is absolute you do n't want people to your game i get it but you 're the game 's performance but denuvo to your so i 'm why the devs chose to over performance quality some of the achievements are out wo n't up even though you did the correct on getting the achievement for example the achievement the cat achievements are locked behind a pay meaning you 'd have to pay for the ultimate edition you wo n't even be able to your achievements this game is n't that or like everyone else in the reviews would state so i do n't know why it was different for me but the can the only i 've encountered throughout the entire game were gwen going when you first her in the and lucas already being open before i got the key to open it myself the ending will always be the same no matter what choices you 've made it also feels like the ending is n't even meant to be an ending rather a cliffhanger to the next chapter also given the text that up at the end of the it that a part of this game will come out but this my that this game is n't even finished the devs could 've given it more time to things up or add more chapters considering that the plot yet has to move forward i do have a few things that i like about this game max caulfield is my favorite character i 'm glad she 's back i 'm glad hannah telle is as her max power from time to this is more fun and i like the in contrast and music between the two we can from the art in the snapping and in max diary i do n't have to be in a romantic relationship with anyone in this game the graphics are stunning i felt like i was into the world of the choice of music is amazing it takes me back to the original lis game tldr do n't buy this game unless it 's on sale wait until `` '' part `` '' of double exposure comes out this game on its i do do n't n't recommend playing this this game there 's 's a a couple why the the plot is the the same as the the first first lis lis game game 's best friend and you you need need to to use power to to save save her she 's a storm storm is and the will be be in you have have to to choose the town your choices especially the supposed to to make make a a huge in the the story it was was never in chapter from the the dead the other and then no one after that that there there 's 's no how this this has happened in in the the first first place it was was n't n't explained at the was this the same that has happened to why was was this you have have to through the the last if you you want want to read the such a that you you can from a a different this was was n't n't explained this is is the the second lis game game with with max max in in it she 's 's a so why why was `` '' photo mode '' '' in the the game game this was a that would us to to have them in in the the lis i 'd 'd have to take in this this game considering that that the the game has a a photo photo mode and that game is is n't n't even chloe price price is is a character and and she she was in this this game game you you only get to a couple couple of of her text messages social media that 's about it `` '' '' nightmare nightmare sequence '' '' in chapter should have have been safi 's nightmare sequence wanting to from the the first first lis lis game game but but i i feel as this this was was a us to has been going through at caledon max i i 'm with safi little to about her all the the game game has in it it it it 's 's the the main why the the performance you do do n't n't want game i i get it but but you you 're the game game 's to your so i i 'm why the the devs chose to some of of the the achievements achievements are wo n't even though you did for example the cat achievements are 'd have have to for the ultimate edition you wo wo n't n't even be able able to to your this game game is is n't everyone else in the so i i do do n't n't know it was for me me but but the the only i 've throughout the the entire entire game game were when you her in in the before i i got to open the ending will always always be be the the same no matter matter what choices you you 've it also feels like like the the ending ending is is n't n't even meant to to be be an an ending a cliffhanger to the the next given the at the the end end of of the that a a part part of of this this game game will but this that this this game game is is n't n't even finished the the devs time to things up considering that that the the plot to move i do have a a few things that that i i like like about about this this game max caulfield caulfield is is my my favorite i 'm 'm glad she 's i 'm 'm glad hannah telle time to this is fun and and i i like like the between the the two we can from the the art in the and in in max i do do n't n't have have to to be be in in a a romantic relationship with in this this game game the the graphics graphics are i felt felt like like i i was into the the world the choice choice of music is it takes back to to the the original original lis lis game do n't buy this this game it 's on sale `` '' `` '' double exposure,negative
as a game i believe that double exposure has the potential to be deeply compelling a supernatural murder mystery with no left behind is impossible for me to up de ’ s heavily in its concept its cast and the setting it takes place in max caulfield is a character who i found at the beginning of my own and because of this a part of me feels like i ’ ve grown up with her returning to her as an and seeing her living her best life feels like a of and a new of hope for my own future unfortunately for those who have played the original game this is where these end de is to the life is strange by name and name alone the original game of life is strange a heavy on the story offered here in a very bad way there is very little players to the world and the story that had been offered ten years the consequences of the of arcadia bay or lack is deeply from the get go it ’ s hard to forget the of the original game and the lack of any real to the original cast save for comments regarding jefferson and victoria only left me feeling like this entire game had been a at what the original had been for despite earlier that the game would both endings of lis with love and respect it ’ s clear to see that this work was with bay in mind with those who chose to save chloe left in the despite being a point of the original story and a for max ’ s powers if you so choose to keep her is handled in a and poor way written off to make room for new love interests that feel and lacking of any real personality all the same characters like safi and moses are from the beginning but they ’ re the only characters that feel other characters feel horny and in there for the sake of simply having them they to mind characters from older games but lack the depth and that made them feel and unique i found myself quite by and gwen only to find myself and my every time they came they too feel like shallow versions of their with the added of being painfully and towards others despite my earlier the story is easily predictable and yet has a massive amount of plot holes and that simply can not be overall i ’ m left feeling as if this game as a whole is less of a sequel to max caulfield ’ s story and more of a rushed work with her face on it for ’ s sake her character is as good as a character can be after for ten years but even that falls flat with how many missed this game has there was room to do something new and nostalgic all the same but it simply feels like nobody wanted to put in the love and that it for those new to the franchise i do believe that this game would to them it ’ s to them without making new players have to replay the game but in the a who have been following from the very beginning i wouldn ’ t recommend this game much at all and for those new looking to experience a romance i ’ d them to original game it may be with its and context but it a deeply unique story that de tries to in a new way but at for the rest of us there ’ s always the comics and fanfiction i as a game i believe that double exposure has the to be murder mystery with no for me me to ’ s cast and and the it takes in max max caulfield caulfield is is a a character i found at the the beginning of my my own because of of this this a a part part of feels like like i i ’ ’ ve grown up up with with her to her her as as an and seeing her best like a and a a new my own for those those who who have played the the original original game game this this is de is to the the life life is is strange the original original game of life life is is strange on the the story in a a very there is is very very little to the the world and the the story story that had been of the of arcadia arcadia bay from the it ’ ’ s s hard hard to of the the original original game game and and the the lack lack of any real to the the original left me me feeling feeling like like this entire game game had had been been a what the the original had been that the the game game would both endings endings of of lis lis with it ’ ’ s to see that this those who who chose chose to to save save chloe in the despite being being a point of of the the original original story story and and a for max max ’ ’ s if you to keep in a to make new love love interests any real all the the same and moses from the the beginning but they they ’ ’ re the only characters that other characters for the characters from games but depth and that made i found found myself to find feel like versions of of their with the the story story is and yet has a a massive amount of plot holes simply can can not not be i ’ ’ m as if if this this game game as as a a whole of a a sequel sequel to to max max caulfield ’ s s story story and and more more of of a with her on it it for ’ s her character character is as good good as as a a character can be but even even that with how this game game has there was to do something new all the the same but it feels like wanted to to put in the the love that it for those new to to the the franchise franchise i i do believe that that this this game game would to them them it it ’ ’ s have to to replay the game game but but in in the who have have been been following from the the very wouldn ’ ’ t recommend this this game at all all and and for for those to experience i ’ ’ d original game game it but it story that tries to in a a new way but for the the rest rest of of us there ’ ’ s comics and,negative
honestly this game lacks in all aspects i have never written a review but after finishing double exposure i can not recommend anyone buy this there is very little content and i finished the game in about hours graphics and sound are good with small bugs but none too but the story is atrocious the whole chloe price thing still the story as presented makes very little sense or is not interesting enough to want you to make sense of it some of the decisions the writers of this game made and how those are presented are completely there are no actual characters of lis present in the game aside from max which is just a lost opportunity to make a connection with the player there are so many little that make no sense like why can i take pictures but only from one no or exposure making all pictures the same anyway so why give me a fake taking pictures action that does nothing this game is short anyway allowing for some self would have made up for a bit of the other the characters other than make are okay at best the romance options are not even options at this point i dont understand if there is one option and you want your max to be or there is just no option aside from that both vinh and amanda are there is just not enough screen time for a connection to moses and safi are the characters you have the most time with and honestly i tell you much about them all other characters are i just dont enough with them i kinda like there could have been fun had there if this game so short gwen seems `` '' cool '' '' but i like her i wish i had more good things to say honestly but even the music is such a letdown compared to all other life is strange in was also bland but now just i life is strange to and if i have some but this game cut it a free dlc for life is strange this game made me depressed for life is strange games honestly this this game in all i have but after double exposure i can can not not recommend buy this there is is very very little and i finished the the game game in graphics and are good but the the story story is the whole chloe price still the the story very little is not enough to you to to make make sense sense of of it some of of the the writers of this this game game made and how there are are no of lis in the the game aside from which is is just just a to make make a with the the player there are are so so many no sense sense like from one the same so why that does this game game is for some would have have made made up up for for a a bit bit of of the the other the characters other than at best the romance romance options options are are not not even at this this point point i if there there is and you you want max to to be there is is just aside from vinh and and amanda there is is just just not time for for a connection to moses and and safi the characters you have have the the most and honestly tell you all other other characters characters are i just with them them i could have have been if this this game `` '' '' '' '' but but i like her her i i wish wish i i had things to to say but even even the the music music is such a compared to to all all other other life life is is strange life is is strange if i i have this game it a for life life is is strange this game game made made me me depressed life is is strange strange games,negative
update at the spoilers ahead in short do not buy the game in the state it is it 's not worth the money i ca n't believe i paid so much money for that sh t why here it is if you thought this game is going to bring you so much from playing as previous lis games then you 're wrong as the one who bought this game in ultimate edition with `` '' cat content '' '' etc i 'm mad and disappointed cause cat makes for only few moments when we 're in max 's that 's all i hate that this game has so many bugs even after full release it 's a `` '' '' '' story from the first game but with and new characters it has the same the storm similar to those from arcadia bay `` '' nightmare '' '' episode game has no sense most of the time also characters talk way too much almost no action happens even tho the game is too short if i did n't try to find every i 'd have finished it even faster than also i hate what they did with chloe from the st game but about it later i like idea of parallel it 's really something new i guess i like the thing where we can take photos as max the character and the too as long as you have because it can out of a the game has many bugs hair going through max 's face doors crashes while changing realities if you change one of the options it 's good but what 's the point to play the game on the when it looks like sh t no nothing even the look better then i do n't know if it 's me but my max had blue hair for half of the episode where she was sometimes it changed between scenes weird i had an amazing bug where i only could with max 's head also `` '' we 'll respect both of the endings from the first game '' '' sure the only ending by the creators is the bay option where chloe obviously dies if you chose bae option does n't matter if you were or just you get the most disappointing outcome no one expected they chloe as this shallow person who left max because `` '' she keeps looking in the past and using powers to rewind and not looking into the future '' '' she barely can use those in the game tho only once actually so even if you chose they were friends you say `` '' you apart from together '' '' later we chloe hates max because her mother got killed in the storm she 'd never do that as far as we know from the first game she 'd respect any choice she makes and chloe probably up with victoria you know the one who was friends with these who killed rachel that does n't even make a slightest sense all of these can be found in max 's journal texts social media and of course max 's she even mentions chloe through the whole game she 's and her as what i can see and still the game us characters we can have romantic relationship with at the end chloe texts max if she 's fine because of the storm she caused like they tried to make a stupid out of her and now she has some heart to text max i hate that they 're going to do some kind of avengers or out of max and and other people i mean it looks like it by the ending that 's the ♥♥♥♥ i ever update before release decknine wo n't make up for it their plan is to `` '' '' '' the series and make it next marvel starting with new characters that 's why they got rid of the old ones this game is based on nostalgia from fans of the st game they knew people would come for max and they did this is actually a cash grab and i got as well as the others well there 's new game from dontnod coming next year `` '' lost records bloom rage '' '' it looks like it has more lis vibe than this at the spoilers ahead in short do not buy the the game game in in the it 's 's not not worth worth the the money i ca ca n't so much for that sh t here it it is if you this game game is is going going to so much lis games then you you 're as the the one this game game in ultimate edition `` '' cat content '' '' i 'm when we we 're in max max 's that 's all i i hate hate that that this this game game has so many full release it 's 's a `` '' '' '' '' story from the the first first game game but but with new characters characters it it has has the the same the storm arcadia bay `` '' '' nightmare '' '' game has has no most of of the the time way too too much the game game is too short if i i did did n't try to to find i 'd 'd have faster than also i i hate what they they did did with with chloe from the game but about it i like idea of it 's 's really something new i guess i like like the the thing we can as max max the the character and the as you you have because it it can out of of a the game game has going through max 's if you one of of the it 's what 's 's the the point to play play the the game on the when it it looks looks like sh t even the i do do n't n't know know if if it it 's me but of the where she she was i had where i with max max 's `` '' respect both both of of the the endings from the the first first game '' '' the only by the the creators is the the bay if you you chose does n't n't matter matter if if you you were you get the most most disappointing no one chloe as as this person who max because `` '' '' she in the the past and not into the the future '' '' '' she in the the game even if if you you chose they were say `` `` '' '' '' max because her mother in the the storm we know from the the first first game and chloe up with with victoria you know the one with these that does does n't n't even make a all of of these can be in max max 's social media and of of course max 's through the the whole whole game she 's her as what i i can can see and still still the the game we can relationship with at the the end if she she 's because of of the the storm tried to to make make a out of of her her and and now she has i hate hate that that they they 're going to to do some kind kind of out of of max max and and other i mean it looks looks like like it by the the ending ending that that 's 's the wo n't n't make up for for it is to `` '' '' '' '' the the series series and make it new characters characters that that 's why they rid of of the this game game is fans of of the game they they knew for max max and and they they did this is a cash cash grab and i i got as well well as as the the others there 's 's new new game game from `` '' lost records records bloom bloom rage '' '' it looks looks like like it it has,negative

not very good feels like a game nobody on it really wanted to make it did me to replay the original and it 's a very the art style is gone the charm is gone the whole detective vibe is gone feels like a game written by which in turn means you can immediately two of the because you know right off the they wo n't be in any sort of negative light you could see the twist coming from a away even if they had n't more or less given it away in a they brought back max so they could on the of a real continuation but they do n't seem to have any interest in that the `` '' bae '' '' ending is getting all the negative but even the `` '' bay '' '' ending is just a of text messages everything is handled so poorly one could easily believe the game was to have a different protagonist and max was in at the th the original was in a nobody at square seems to understand why it was good and after this many terrible it 's probably time to it in and let the name rest very good feels like like a a game on it it really really wanted wanted to to make make it it did me to to replay the original and it it 's 's a a very the art is gone is gone the whole is gone feels like like a a game you can two of of the because you you know off the wo n't n't be in any sort of you could could see see the the twist from a even if if they they had had n't it away in a they brought back max so they they could on the of a but they they do do n't seem to to have have any in that that the the `` `` '' '' '' '' ending ending is all the but even even the the `` `` '' '' '' '' ending ending is is just just a text messages so poorly the game game was to have have a a different and max max was at the the original in a seems to understand why it was after this it 's time to it in and let let the,negative
trash game made by trash writers definitely not worth your time if you about the first game and its characters de somehow to disrespect all endings of the first game and completely the core relationship of the first one it does n't even matter if you decided to stay friends with chloe the friend is equally characters in de are often over the top and often completely to the plot forward including our player character the majority of them are boring as too and unlike the first game in the series i did n't feel to get to know any of them game made made by not worth worth your your time if you about the the first first game game and and its endings of of the the first first game game and of the the first first one it does does n't n't even matter if if you decided to with chloe chloe the characters in in de are often over the the plot character the majority of of them them are unlike the the first first game game in in the the series series i i did did n't n't feel to get get to to know any of of them,negative
here i am just finished the game i went into life is strange double exposure with high hopes especially excited to see max again looked forward to the and nostalgic atmosphere i was long time ago with the previous games sadly i got hit quite quickly with the reality my when i all the characters felt very short and shallow there was no real depth to any of them it was more important what they had and this made a lot of feeling very forced the character was missing a lot of times i did not get in the story at all it often felt very short and rushed at some points i truly missed the first game while playing this one the writing felt rushed and far from what i playing deck games there were n't much plot moments all was over before you knew it in any way i have to give this game a down the music was great and seeing max was awesome but the story was not what i was hoping for here i i am just finished finished the the game game i life is is strange strange double double exposure high hopes excited to to see see max max again forward to to the i was long time with the the previous previous games i got with the when i all the the characters short and there was was no no real to any any of of them them it it was they had and this made a a lot lot of the character a lot lot of times i i did did not in the the story at all all it short and the first first game while playing playing this this one one the the writing felt rushed rushed and from what what i there were were n't you knew it in in any any way way i i have have to to give give this this game game a down the the music was great and seeing seeing max max was but the the story story was was not what i i was was hoping,negative

overall underwhelming as a fan of the life is strange series i truly wanted to enjoy double exposure but by the time i reached chapters and the game had unfortunately lost its it felt like a storm speaking of spoiler the of the storm from the first game felt forced and out of place lacking the emotional weight it in life is strange this time around i to with the characters who felt distant and to to vinh reggie diamond safi ’ s mother and even safi the supposed main character lacked the depth i expected one of the most disappointing aspects was how the game away core elements of the original story in how it chloe chloe was a part of max ’ s life and story yet double exposure seems to her presence to mentions rather than fully exploring her impact it feels and to handle such a compelling character this way especially given chloe ’ s role in life is strange visually the game the graphics are beautiful with and that life into the world however strong visuals couldn ’ t make up for the writing the antagonist side characters and narrative fall short compared to life is strange before the storm and life is strange the ending in lacks weight as the supposed reveal feels predictable with little mystery for players who have been following the story in previous games the characters and world felt engaging and making the emotional even when heavily into certain themes here however that connection is missing leaving double exposure feeling flat and ultimately underwhelming as a fan of of the the life life is is strange series i wanted to to enjoy double exposure by the the time time i chapters and and the the game game had it felt like a a storm speaking of of the the storm from the the first first game game felt forced and and out out of of place the emotional in life life is is strange this time with the the characters safi ’ ’ s and even the supposed main character lacked the the depth i expected one of of the the most most disappointing how the the game elements of of the the original original story how it chloe was was a part of of max max ’ ’ s and story double exposure seems to rather than it feels to handle such a chloe ’ ’ s in life life is is strange the game the graphics graphics are into the the world couldn ’ ’ t up for for the writing the the antagonist side characters characters and compared to to life life is is strange before the the storm storm and life is is strange the ending as the the supposed with little who have have been been following following the the story previous games the characters characters and making the the emotional even when double exposure and ultimately,negative
the most disappointing title in the series so far a horrible cash grab with no life and no soul completely missing every single mark that made the first life is strange so special the first three chapters set up for something great then off of a cliff for the worst `` '' ending '' '' to a game i have ever played the most most disappointing in the the series so far cash grab with no every single that made made the the first first life life is is strange the first first three three chapters set up up for for something off of of a for the the worst `` '' '' ending '' '' '' to to a a game game i i have ever played,negative
it was honestly pretty good until the fourth chapter they threw the storyline and characters out of the for a pretty bad marvel like ending it was pretty good until the the fourth out of of the for a pretty bad,negative
playing the first game made me depressed because it was so good playing this game made me depressed because they reduced the life is strange to nothing more than a literally cash grab the first first game game made made me me depressed because it it was was so so good playing this this game game made made me me depressed because they the life life is is strange nothing more more than cash grab,negative
crashes and to the point where it 's the little amount i was able to play i was by to the point where i do n't even want to continue even if the crashes are imagine the cringy dialogue of the original life is strange but with the to like bad marvel dialogue and without the aspects that made it charming or and that 's every line to the the point point where it 's i was able to to play i was to the the point point where where i i do do n't n't even want to to continue even if if the of the the original original life life is is strange strange but but with with the to like that made made it and that that 's,negative
tldr consider waiting for all the episodes to be released first before buying the cringe is still and but the lack of a age feature to carry over choices from previous games instead you ’ re asked to story decisions which feels a huge in max 's story is handled with and after two hours of play max ’ s new powers and i ’ t even used them pacing on boring extra for a buggy early release is the game even you to change settings if it about a patch instead performance is with frame and random though animations are safi ’ s death is over with an skip and max 's response feels with flat voice acting doing little to emotion release makes little is square enix not an studio for cash even the scene were max safi 's feels shallow no shock effect no had more emotion in than max the gameplay of “ find x to cause y ” feels and while max ’ s is given her into a specific romantic path feels from the first game where she could explore options for all all the to be is still but the the lack lack of of a previous games you ’ ’ re a huge in max max 's 's story story is hours of max ’ ’ s new powers and i ’ t t even for a the game you to if it safi ’ ’ s and max max 's voice acting little to square enix even the safi 's max the the gameplay while max max ’ ’ s into a from the the first first game where she,negative
never had to write a bad review before but this is just such a let down i had to honestly this game feels unfinished it 's one of those things where i can see a lot of people it never happened and moving on it really seems like they knew the first game was such a hit they brought max back because they knew people would play it just for that the cat dlc being only in the version of the game is atrocious and i only twice during this whole game and that 's really saying something spoilers ahead multiple parts do n't make any sense like if safi is able to by others then how can she frame gwen on and the biggest issue for me overall is chloe what was the point of over and over her coming back and then absolutely nothing you get a text in the end that 's it it basically made the whole first games big ending pointless because it never anyway in the about her story about what happened between her and max and even get 's to a point max is over the to her and then it never happens what a total let down then at the very end the game says max caufield will return it feels like the whole up to chloe and other questions were just left for another game to finish off and that 's if they even finish the chloe stuff off had to to write a bad but this this is is just such a let down i had had to honestly this this game game feels it 's one of of those where i i can can see see a a lot lot of of people it never on it it really seems like like they they knew the first first game game was such a they brought max back because they they knew play it it just just for for that that the the cat cat dlc in the of the the game game is whole game game and and that that 's 's really spoilers ahead do n't n't make sense like like if safi is able to and the the biggest for me what was was the the point point of over and and over back and and then you get get a a text in the the end that 's it it made the the whole because it it never in the about her about what what happened her and and max max and and even even get to a max is over the her and and then it never a total let down at the the very the game caufield will will return it feels feels like like the the whole up to to chloe chloe and and other were just just left another game game to to finish and that that 's if they they even the chloe chloe stuff,negative
the story was interesting in the beginning and max 's new powers were a gameplay mechanic but unfortunately the story on its face at the end none of your choices matter you can literally on your new love interest and it changes nothing neither one of them really you can disrespect your love interest go against her wish and kiss another version of her in another and all she says is `` '' that 's a bit weird '' also the ending is just out of two choices like the first game if you chose to save chloe last game do n't matter you break up anyway chloe might as well be dead you never see her none of the characters from the previous game come back at all chloe 's mom but that 's only through text and you can victoria 's social media for some reason it 's a cast of completely people who all try to be the despite their actions being there are only two people i feel for in the entire cast and that 's max either keeps them or just straight up them when they need a friend the most max at no point about how her actions might people and nobody really her out for it at random points the game references last game when max gets in jefferson 's and i would n't mind on that trauma but the moments last actual seconds and feels more like shock more than with real trauma she would have also do n't buy any of the not worth the money outfits are ♥♥♥♥ and you do n't see them most of the time she her i played and saw the cat twice only got to pet once and then he out of offered it he did n't even it the story story was in the the beginning and max max 's 's new new powers the story on its its face at the the end none of of your your choices choices matter you can on your new love love interest and it one of of them you can love interest of her her in `` '' that 's 's a a bit also the the ending ending is is just out of like the the first first game game if if you you chose chose to to save save chloe last game game do do n't n't matter you break break up might as as well none of of the the characters characters from from the the previous previous game come back at all chloe 's but that that 's 's only and you you can social media for some reason it it 's 's a people who try to to be be the there are i feel in the the entire cast and and that that 's them or when they a friend the most no point out for for it the game last game and i i would would n't but the more like more than would have do n't any of of the not worth worth the the money outfits are and you you do do n't see them most of of the the time i played the cat and then out of did n't n't even,negative
life is strange de is the worst game the game series of course it 's my opinion for anyone that is reading this for the of not wanting to get about the game i ask you to stop reading this one there was no character development at all for moses compared to all the others the choices did n't really the outcome at all the whole game feels like a simulator where you play as max who has n't from her past at all the previous life is strange games she was in if you chose to save chloe it only changes what max tells to safi and you get a couple of posts from her and in the end she basically says '' oh no i 'm sorry that the storm came to you again '' and max ca n't even have a chance to to her at all some of the did n't resolve at all even by the end of the game they just completely from the `` '' plot '' '' for example reggie 's mystery and how that `` '' alderman '' '' no matter what even though he had been a to max earlier you got the feeling he would play a major role but clearly no safi 's where she had powers suddenly changes at the end to make her a whether you or her final offer nothing bad or good happens from it and suddenly the character diamond has powers because of some `` '' f you '' '' to the plot no one questions that max has powers too or even more that everyone else suddenly starts having powers too i just ca n't understand how they reached that in this game series honestly the whole game feels like a mess from a studio that does n't know or understand how the other life is strange games worked or felt and then it leaves a bad in your mouth with the ending where there 's some and ultimate version that just a few outfits and a cat imagine that paying € for a game for extra content that is just in a single player game i want to add now later on i personally hate to see where the game series is going this game the current game does not feel like a life is strange game it 's just not the right one life is is strange de is is the the worst worst game the game game series series of of course it 's my opinion that is for the wanting to to get about the the game game i you to this one there was was no no character character development at all compared to to all all the the others the choices did n't n't really at all all the the whole whole game game feels feels like like a where you play as as max who has from her her past at all the previous life is is strange strange games she was was in if you you chose chose to to save save chloe to safi and you you get get a a couple couple of from her her and and in in the the end no i i 'm 'm sorry that the the storm to you '' and and max ca n't n't even have a a chance to her at all some of of the did n't at all by the the end end of of the the game game they they just from the the `` `` '' '' '' for example and how `` '' '' '' no matter matter what even though had been been a to max a major safi 's where she at the the end end to to make it and the character has powers because of `` '' '' '' '' to to the the plot no one that max max has has powers powers too even more everyone else powers too i just ca n't n't understand how they in this this game game series the whole whole game game feels feels like like a from a that does does n't n't know how the the other other life life is is strange strange games and then a bad with the the ending there 's a few and a a cat for a a game game for that is is just in a game i i want want to to see where the the game game series is going this game game the game does does not feel like like a life is is strange strange game game it it 's 's just just not not the,negative
opinion about the game terrible i ca n't even find words to this even though i knew chloe was n't in it i wanted to try again and play but it 's really such a bad start and how can they mess this up so badly graphics compared to earlier games it 's truly horrible the and are so weird and not to mention the crashes and low frame audio the game starts with good music i have to that story every minute you play the game it the relationship between chloe and max and is to chloe as a bad person i do n't think there 's another game that its own game world this much to throw away everything they did with lis and bts all at once and as if that were n't enough to try to it apart with forced do n't understand what they 're trying to do they 're clearly saying that they do n't want to any profit from this game for those who bae never choose the bae option chloe is better dead than alive and living this nonsense safi also seems like a very uninteresting character compared to chloe i everyone who has ruined a game that could have so much potential with such bad decisions you all deserve an especially starting with this refund about the the game i ca ca n't n't even even though though i chloe was was n't in it it i i wanted wanted to to try again and but it it 's 's really such a a bad and how so badly compared to it 's are so not to to mention mention the the game i have have to play the the game game it chloe and and max max and and is chloe as as a a bad i do do n't there 's another game game that own game much to to throw throw away they did did with lis and as if if that were n't enough to to try try to it apart do n't n't understand what they they 're trying to to do they 're that they they do do n't n't want want to this game game for for those those who choose the the bae chloe is seems like like a a very compared to to chloe chloe i who has a game game that could have so much you all with this,negative
i expected more but it ’ s buggy and the story just isn ’ t as compelling as the original games those for the of the earlier games would be better off them i expected more but but it it ’ ’ s and the the story isn ’ ’ t as the the original for the of the the earlier would be be better,negative
for now game simply does n't and when it all are waiting on a does n't when it on a,negative
no spoiler review i have a life is strange i think this is the first review i 've ever left tldr i thought the game was a cash grab but gave it a chance really liked the first two episodes during and thought it was for one choice they made after episode they said `` '' this is a cash grab lol you paid for a nonsense story with a side of '' this is the worst game in the franchise unfortunately i was at first but loved the story of the first two episodes despite some gameplay i made a joke to my about the twist of the game that turned out to be true and it 's downhill from there gameplay there are no puzzles there are three new and using them is either incredibly obvious or it 's super and the game you know exactly when to use it the game tells you how to solve every single problem to put it into the one thing i thought was a puzzle was a that i could n't open in one scene the was to try to open the a second time and it worked that 's not a puzzle lol small but the journal does n't open to the page which was annoying by the end story the feature is so weird because you usually only have one response you can say the social media feature really added nothing to the world it 's always x thing happens and then every character at once posts a of `` '' did you hear about x '' '' there were so few hard choices and only a couple characters i really loved the game really puts you on and you to feel specific ways about different characters you into only saying bad things about a character because they you 'll dislike them because that 's what they the story was good at first but episode was so bad they lines and entire from lis by the end of the game they really on the of the mystery is really small no spoilers imagine the entire game around one character another character years ago not time and the universe not travel to avoid not a taking over a town it 's drama that 's more than actual drama i saw in in real life the only high stakes thing that happens is from the original game and makes no sense at all in the context of this game this is n't `` '' life is strange '' '' its `` '' life is a little bit odd '' the fact they entire of lis in the final episode also from the main point of in the game it makes the issue also seem and about that without spoilers that one key event to a person 's and that that can be on exactly one person with no one else at fault like that 's insane and they have the to plan to make another cash grab when they did n't even have a full story out for this one they definitely tried to set up the with the ending there lol it 's honestly kind of a to the franchise dontnod you will always be bloom rage review i i have have a a life life is is strange i think this is is the the first review i i 've 've ever i thought the game game was was a a cash cash grab it a a chance the first first two two episodes it was they made they said `` '' this is is a a cash cash grab for a with a this is is the the worst worst game game in in the the franchise i was at first first but loved the the story of the the first first two two episodes i made made a about the the twist of the the game game that to be and it it 's there are are no there are it 's and the the game you know to use use it it the the game how to to solve every single to put the one i thought was a was a that i i could could n't in one to try try to to open time and and it that 's 's not not a but the does n't to the by the the end is so because you you can social media nothing to to the the world it 's and then `` '' did you '' '' there were choices and only a a couple characters i i really loved the the game you to you into things about a character because they that 's what they story was at first first but was so so bad from lis by the the end end of of the the game game they they really of the the mystery mystery is is really the entire entire game time and to avoid not a it 's that 's i saw in real real life the only thing that from the the original original game game and makes no no sense at all all in in the of this this game game this this is is n't `` '' life is is strange '' '' `` '' life is is a a little '' the the fact of lis in the the final from the the main point of in the the game game it it makes to a a person and that can be with no no one that 's and they they have have the to make cash grab when they they did did n't n't even have a a full out for for this this one tried to to set set up up the with the the ending it 's kind of of a to the the franchise you will will always always be bloom rage,negative

it to give this a it really does the first life is strange was in a and is still one of my favourite games ever start with the positives the have done a great job it 's great to hear hannah telle as max again the rest of the cast was very good too the first three episodes are pretty good the story sets itself up to be an intriguing and kept me wanting to play more until it all went downhill with the two episodes which felt rushed pointless and an ending that left me feeling nothing no no i was just there thinking `` '' oh it okay '' the atmosphere and soundtrack graphics and the feel to it are great a photo mode is missed but this game does look and sound pretty it definitely `` '' feels '' '' like a lis game for the first few episodes now to the negatives there is no emotional weight to anything i do n't need to have my soul again by a but this story and it 's characters do nothing to actually make me care about the story with loose ends and compared to the earlier mentioned first game which had a great and finish to its story this just left me feel nothing your choices do n't matter at all way too much time and was into wanting to make this a avengers kind of thing that absolutely nobody wants to have from a technical this game is a mess visual glitches my is old yes but like and others run as on max this one is far off i wanted to like this game i actually did for some time regardless of the technical issues but i sadly just ca n't the direction the whole story has i do n't want a avengers to give give this this a it really the first first life life is is strange strange was in a and is is still one of of my with the positives the a great great job it 's 's great hannah telle as max max again the rest rest of of the the cast was very very good the first first three three episodes episodes are are pretty pretty good good the the story up to to be be an wanting to to play until it it all with the two episodes felt rushed and an an ending ending that left me me feeling i was was just `` '' '' the graphics and and the a photo photo mode but this this game game does `` '' '' '' like a a lis lis game game for for the the first first few to the there is is no i do do n't n't need need to to have by a but this this story story and and it it 's nothing to care about about the the story loose ends compared to to the the earlier first game game which had a a great to its this just just left left me your choices choices do do n't n't matter at all way too too much time and wanting to to make make this this a kind of thing that wants to to have from a this game game is is a on max this one one is i wanted wanted to to like like this this game game i for some regardless of of the technical issues issues but but i ca n't the whole i do do n't n't want want a,negative
so here i am doing something i never thought i would do giving a negative review on a life is strange game some spoilers now to explain why this is a big deal for me i this franchise i have combined hours on all games now including this one and replay lis and lis on a i like even the true colors and to a before the storm and am even comics and other media because this franchise really did speak to me and yet here i am and i do believe that not only i am not this game ever i might myself to perhaps watching the next one on or maybe it once it is on like from a person who used to these i was the one for deck on etc their as one of the few that enjoyed true colors but it is not obvious that it was kind of they have no idea what the fans want what made the franchise special and what to so many the choices are bland and the soundtrack is not special at all something that all games very well so far the characters are of no to a where sometimes feel like rather than actual interesting worth exploring but most if you are of the and of the original do not touch it be i was myself to play this game after about minutes in deck resolved one of the if not the most out text a text nothing more nothing less their to the story is the same as if there was a sequel to of the in which we find out through an off that was actually an f up and let 's focus on a different story instead of power if you will just i am truly sorry to say this and i hope that perhaps someone in the writing this all the others ones who had no decisions in the creative you did a great job with what you had been given truly you are that decided that this is the way to handle this at least for me you had killed a towards a franchise that for nearly a decade hope you are of over so here here i i am something i i would would do on a a life life is is strange strange game this is is a a big big deal for me me i this franchise franchise i i have this one lis and on a i like even the true colors colors and to a before the the storm storm and and other because this this franchise to me and yet here i i am and i i do believe that that not not only i am am not this game the next it is from a a person person who i was was the the one one of of the the few true colors but it it is is not that it it was kind of they have have no no idea what the the fans made the the franchise and what so many the choices bland and is not at all something that that all so far far the the characters characters are to a feel like rather than if you you are of the the original do not i was to play play this this game one of of the not the the most a text nothing more to the the story story is is the the same as if if there there was was a a sequel sequel to of the in which up and and let let 's on a a different if you you will i am to say say this and i i hope hope that in the the writing all the the others had no in the you did did a a great great job with what what you you had had been you are that this this is is the the way way to to handle at least for me you had a decade you are,negative
i really wish i could give a review positives the game is really pretty the music is good hannah telle voice did an amazing job the characters have personality and i really like moses had many `` '' what is '' '' moments chapter negatives there are so many lines from lis like there are so many old voice lines which for me feels like a in your face they max and personality just for the sake of fan drama they suddenly up did n't the devs read their own comics max out an city to chloe they are meant for each other even they do n't respect the bae ending even though it 's canon in lis a cat dlc which about € the content you get is find the cat cat on pet the cat cat ending it 's not even minutes of content there are even achievements for the cat dlc which literally means they put a € behind achievements the sequel bait in the end is terrible `` '' max will return `` '' stop max and chloe deck nine honestly the game would be so much better with a new just create a new cast it 's fine but do n't already existing characters it 's a good game if you do n't care about the endings and max relationship i guess but just order lost records bloom rage it 's the og i really wish i i could positives the the game game is is really the music music is is good good hannah hannah telle the characters characters have i really really like `` '' what is '' '' there are are so so many from lis there are are so so many for me feels like like a max and just for for the did n't the devs their own they are each other they do do n't respect the the bae bae ending even though it 's in lis a cat cat dlc you get find the the cat the cat ending it it 's 's not not even minutes of there are for the the cat cat dlc the sequel in the the end `` '' '' max will return `` '' max and and chloe deck nine the game game would would be so much with a a new create a a new it 's do n't characters it it 's 's a a good good game game if if you you do do n't n't care care about about the the endings i guess lost records records bloom bloom rage it 's 's the the og,negative
de forma did not respect bae decision instead of and a decision that of players made the devs just decided that bae was the evil and wrong decision without even thinking about what the original game was about what max 's character is really through and why max even would consider the bay i enjoyed before the storm despite some weird decisions behind it i enjoyed true colours however with this deck nine has that they do n't care about the original life is strange games its not their so why would they instead they go around the studio talking about what is the least ending and how to people who chose the `` '' wrong '' '' ending this will be my last life is strange game i 'll ever play or buy dont nod is lost records next year and unlike deck nine dont nod will actually respect your decisions in a decision based game do better deck nine good job off of your potential real decision next lis game will it after all every action has consequences did not not respect instead of made the the devs was the about what what the the original original game game was about what max 's character is is really and why why max the bay i enjoyed before the the storm it i i enjoyed true colours with this deck nine nine has that they they do do n't n't care care about about the the original original life life is is strange strange games so why the studio about what what is is the the least ending and and how how to people who who chose the `` `` '' '' '' '' ending will be life is is strange strange game game i i 'll dont nod lost records deck nine dont nod in a game do deck nine off of of your lis game game will,negative
are you new here you have no clue who chloe price is good the start of the game will be weird but you should enjoy the rest oh you know who chloe is oh who she was yes yes of course you should be fine as well enjoy you 're one of those people who spent a amount of time and the alive in the first game i thought we got rid of you all oh you still want to play this game sure sure please come in right on the over there i 'll just attached those around you and now you 're ready for this long simulator from what is available in those first two chapters if you are a fan of chloe price stay away if you do n't care for her or if she already left than i guess you wo n't mind after early access chapter to so this as canon was my only way to continue having max as a a bit it was just a continuation of my previous tho the story might not be that great but i would have been happy with it if they had n't done what they did to chloe and max the extra are not worth it for the few moments of cat content and they really need to fix the light problem they have i guess i 'll still have life is strange around in my head but it will be by this experience are you you have have no chloe price price is is good good the of the the game game will will be but you you should the rest you know chloe is she was of course you should as well you 're one of of those people who amount of of time time and in the the first first game game i i thought we got rid of you all want to to play play this this game on the i 'll and now you 're for this from what what is first two two chapters if you you are are a a fan fan of of chloe chloe price if you you do do n't n't care for her if she than i i guess you wo wo n't early access only way way to to continue as a a bit it was was just just a a continuation of my the story not be but i i would would have have been with it if they they had had n't what they they did to chloe chloe and and max max the are not not worth worth it it for for the the few cat content and they they really need to they have i guess i 'll life is is strange in my but it it will will be by this,negative
finished the game and i 'm really disappointed i 'll st say if you want this game then just buy the version the outfits are just versions of the base outfits and the `` '' cat '' '' they kept talking about has at most minutes worth of content the game starts strong with episodes both being really good episode and were decent too but episode was painfully and a really bad end to this narrative the game also has glitches such as not as they should such as an being open when its meant to be locked and doors being out of place this game also had worse performance than all the other lis games and i had issues of loading in very a lot of people seem to that this is a good game but not a good life is strange due to its focus on supernatural elements and trying to create a story that will games while moving away from elements that made the life is strange series feel special to a lot of fans i think it as both but if you do want a game more focused on the more supernatural elements of the series then you might enjoy this on sale finished the the game game and and i i 'm i 'll if you you want this game buy the outfits are are just versions of of the and the the `` `` '' '' '' the game episode and and a really bad end to to this narrative the the game as they they should as an meant to to be out of of place this game also had all the the other lis games games and and i i had a lot lot of of people seem to that this this is is a a good good game game but but not not a a good life is is strange due to to its trying to to create create a story that that will away from that made made the the life life is is strange to a a lot lot of i think but if if you you do want a a game on the elements of of the the series then you on sale,negative
i think i 'm going through the same fans felt about the sequel cause what the ♥♥♥♥ i think i 'm going through through the the same about the the sequel what the the ♥♥♥♥,negative
it ’ s hard to say much without the other chapters so far the game is enjoyable and i love to see max all grown up but still a saying “ ” little and such she seemingly true to her character from the first game and honestly that ’ s all anyone can ask for when it comes to a returning character i saw quite a few bugs especially if you go back to your checkpoint the characters bug out a lot i guess deck nine really didn ’ t for such even when it ’ s a very option and an option in general as well if you use the skip certain parts option it bugs the characters and environment out a lot as well which to a moment where max was her hand against something when you had to que e to essentially make it which timeline it was in when it comes to the romance options i ’ m not a big fan of how minutes in or so you ’ re met with amanda who you immediately have to pick if you ’ re going to romance her or not we have no idea that if you pick her as a friend at first if you ’ ll be able to into romance again once the other chapters are out i ’ d like to have known her a bit more in the story before being given the choice of having a on her especially when it takes max to vinh and in general be flirty with him it feels like amanda is at you more since we ’ ve only heavily seen max with a girl before being chloe it ’ s as if they want you to just she ’ s your only option i don ’ t really like vinh ’ s character so far seeing as he still is a bit flirty with max even when you him again and again “ with your is sexy be sexy max ” yeah no i ’ m good he ’ s also not really as a romanceable option unless you at the achievements i hope he doesn ’ t just stay this character the whole way through another thing with vinh is that he ’ s a romanceable character even though he ’ s one of the behind safi ’ s murder case it feels a bit off that if it does end up being him even though it is it will be quite a to romance him and get doesn ’ t even make sense to have vinh as a romanceable character in general when he ’ s a now the bae or bay ending is something i had no idea how deck nine was going to handle i sadly have to say that it was done very poorly with no to the fans no to the comics before the storm and the whole franchise in general how chloe and max break up if you choose the bae ending is something that feels so out of character for chloe chloe ’ s were to max in before the storm saying things about how much she missed max and she never gave up on her during the first life is strange game we see how the two of them have their and here and there but they together whether or not i genuinely see them as that even though chloe is to die max is not to let that happen and chloe that in the comics the whole of and everyone else comes up and chloe doesn ’ t max in the slightest she says “ i you i couldn ’ t hear her but i could hear you you couldn ’ t have max there was no right or wrong choice and i ’ m through feeling like i ’ t of your decision i ’ m sorry if i made it on you ” as well “ max i ’ m going to to you what you said to me so many times when we first left we don ’ t know we can not know for sure that we caused the storm we know some crazy ♥♥♥♥ happened we know that you ’ t let that crazy ♥♥♥♥ happen again we know that i am here we know that there was a storm that ’ s it you can ’ t it all i can ’ t to believe that our lives can cause on this level the thought now ” with all of this it just feels so wrong that chloe would go back on everything go back on max i feel like deck nine didn ’ t know what to do with chloe at all so they felt this was the only option if this was all they could think of then maybe a new game with max isn ’ t what we should ’ ve if they wanted to away from chloe and the bae ending i ’ ll stop now and say i hope the game past chapter i enjoyed the small bit of cat content we got in chapter and i ’ m looking forward to seeing more of my cat for now i ’ ll have to give double exposure a negative until we see more this game has potential for a crazy story i just hope deck nine doesn ’ t mess it up more it ’ ’ s s hard hard to to say the other so far far the the game game is and i i love to see see max grown up to her her character from the the first first game game and and honestly that ’ ’ s when it to a i saw quite a a few if you go back back to to your the characters out a a lot i guess deck nine didn ’ ’ t even when when it it ’ ’ s s a a very and an an option in general as well if you the characters characters and out a a lot as well to a a moment where max max was when you you had had to make it it was was in when it to the the romance romance options i ’ ’ m not a a big fan of you ’ ’ re have to if you you ’ ’ re going to to romance or not we have have no no idea that if if you her as as a a friend at first if you you ’ ’ ll be able able to the other chapters are i ’ ’ d like to to have a bit in the the story given the the choice choice of on her when it it takes vinh and and in in general it feels feels like we ’ ’ ve with a it ’ ’ s as if if they they want you to to just she ’ ’ s i don don ’ ’ t t really really like ’ s so far as he is a a bit with max even when when you again and with your no i i ’ ’ m he ’ ’ s s also not really as a a romanceable unless you at the the achievements i hope doesn ’ ’ t character the the whole is that he ’ ’ s s a a romanceable even though he ’ ’ s one of of the safi ’ ’ s it feels a bit that if if it it does end up even though it is it will will be quite a to romance him and doesn ’ ’ t t even make sense to have as a a romanceable character in in general he ’ ’ s s a the bae bay ending ending is is something something i i had had no no idea deck nine was going going to to handle have to to say say that that it it was with no to the the fans to the the comics before the the storm storm and and the the whole in general chloe and and max break up if you you choose choose the the bae bae ending ending is is something something that that feels feels so so out out of of character character for for chloe chloe ’ ’ s to max max in in before before the the storm things about how much max and she never up on on her the first first life life is is strange strange game we see see how how the the two two of of them and there or not see them that even even though chloe is to die max is is not and chloe in the the comics the whole and everyone everyone else up and and chloe doesn ’ ’ t max in in the the slightest couldn ’ ’ t but i i could couldn ’ ’ t t have there was was no and i i ’ ’ m feeling like like i ’ t of your i ’ ’ m if i i made made it as well “ max max i i ’ ’ m going to to you what you to me so many many times when we don ’ ’ t we can can not that we the storm we know we know know that that you ’ t we know know that that i i am here we we know know that that there there was was a a storm that ’ ’ s you can can ’ ’ t it all all i i can can ’ ’ t to believe believe that on this with all all of of this it just just feels feels so chloe would would go go back go back on max max i i feel feel like deck nine didn ’ ’ t know what to do with chloe at all so they this was was the the only if this this was was all they could a new new game game with with max isn ’ ’ t what we should ’ ’ ve if they wanted to away from chloe and and the the bae bae ending ending i i ’ ’ ll now and say i i hope hope the the game i enjoyed bit of cat content we got in chapter chapter and and i i ’ ’ m forward to more of of my i ’ ’ ll have to to give double exposure we see this game game has for a story i i just deck nine doesn ’ ’ t,negative
life is strange double exposure tries to up on the first game but ends up being and unoriginal as what 's presented here is essentially just the first game 's story but with extra of that do nothing but make the game a confusing mess the game our main character max caulfield from the first game a at caledon who must solve the mystery of her new best friend 's death she discovers she has the ability to between two timelines one where safi is alive and must use it to try and solve the mystery behind her death max caulfield now has the power to between two timelines to solve her friend 's death but this of the first game 's plot lacks charm and depth characters are poorly and love interests amanda and vinh play very minimal that will hardly make any player care about them enough to romance them max 's new power as well as the of her old one also more questions than it answers further the of the powers which has already been a huge the life is strange community the final chapters chapter and chapter are a confusing mess leaving many plot points and in an ending that nothing i you not i ca n't tell you what chapter is even about because it 's so and confusing i genuinely asked out during my playthrough `` '' what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on '' overall double exposure is a disappointing sequel that leaves players more confused than ending with a to black yet another sequel oh yeah did i forget to mention the cherry on top of this ♥♥♥♥ is a to black screen saying `` '' max caulfield will return '' '' yes another sequel how `` '' '' '' if this game is anything to go by edit i was gon na replay this game to try and see if i missed some major things as well as try and get some more achievements but i just found out that two of the achievements are locked behind the cat dlc meaning you ca n't even this game unless you pay up for extra content for that alone this game is getting an from me life is is strange strange double double exposure tries to up on on the the first first game game but what 's just the the first first game game 's 's story but with that do nothing but make the the game game a the game main character max caulfield from the the first first game game a at caledon solve the the mystery of her her new new best best friend she has has the ability to between two two timelines safi is is alive use it to try try and solve the the mystery max caulfield has the the power power to between two two timelines timelines to to solve but this of the the first first game game 's characters are love interests that will care about enough to to romance max 's 's new new power as well well as as the of her of the the powers been a a huge the life life is is strange the final are a in an ending that i ca ca n't tell you is even because it it 's 's so my playthrough `` '' what the the ♥♥♥♥ is going double exposure exposure is is a with a to black another sequel to mention mention the the cherry cherry on on top of this is a to black `` '' '' max max caulfield caulfield will will return return '' '' '' another sequel `` '' '' '' if this this game game is to go i was gon na this game game to to try try and if i as well well as try and but i i just two of of the the achievements achievements are cat dlc you ca ca n't n't even this game unless you up for for that this game game is,negative
so i just finished it and yeah it 's not great i love the first game more than i should it hit me right in my years at the perfect time the sequels i mean fine i like true colors i read the comics even read the and my top is my favorite you get it so when deck nine threw out the promise of a sequel to max caulfield 's story i felt that that i 'd go in fair wouldn ’ t it over the fact that they decided to chloe and max up not gon na lie i ’ m really mad and my fan heart is but double exposure ’ s to that would do the rest of the game a disservice i hate that i can ’ t turn off my own mind the way i can when watching it 's like the moment i let myself pick it apart the whole thing just started to the writing the pacing all over the damn place puzzles while cool in concept feel on and are never far enough also they existing after episode don ’ t play it for the puzzles but why them at all then and for a game that ’ s all about choice it felt like my choices were at best the fact that we play as max again mostly feels like a move it would n't have made a worse story if it was about someone else the are fun and i enjoyed all of them but they ’ t really for the plot i really like the the music is great and the characters have potential but ultimately they ’ re reduced to just one with no real development or growth i keep telling myself it ’ s okay that it doesn ’ t what the other games mean to me but in some way it kinda does the first one had this this weirdly coherent mess of mystery that felt even when it didn ’ t give you all the answers but here we ’ re all over the place watching some guy get from reality and everyone ’ s just fine no no mention just gone after with a mechanic that never happens before or after it 's just weird and random and max ’ s powers they ’ re plot now out only when the story needs a with no real behind them and it was short so here ’ s my review i had fun kinda in that “ turn off your ” way but god i wish i didn ’ t have the space to pick it apart beyond those two seconds of also it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ avengers ass ending so i i just just finished it and it 's 's not i love love the the first first game more than than i right in in my at the i mean i like true colors read the the comics read the and my is my my favorite you get it so deck nine of a a sequel sequel to to max max caulfield 's story story i i felt i 'd wouldn ’ ’ t over the the fact fact that that they decided to chloe and and max gon na i ’ ’ m and my double exposure ’ s that would would do rest of of the the game game a a disservice i hate hate that that i i can can ’ ’ t my own the way way i i can it 's 's like like the the moment it apart the whole whole thing the writing writing the all over over the don ’ ’ t play it it for for the the puzzles at all and for for a a game game that that ’ ’ s all about it felt felt like at best the fact fact that that we play as as max max again feels like like a it would would n't n't have have made made a if it it was fun and and i i enjoyed all of of them but they ’ t t really for the the plot i really really like like the the music music is is great and the the characters characters have they ’ ’ re to just with no no real it ’ ’ s that it doesn ’ ’ t what the the other other games to me me but but in in some the first first one mystery that even when when it didn ’ ’ t give you you all all the but here here we we ’ ’ re all over over the and everyone ’ s s just with a it 's 's just and max max ’ ’ s they ’ ’ re when the the story with no no real them and and it it was so here ’ s i had in that way but i wish wish i didn ’ ’ t t have have the it apart it has has a,negative

the game is painfully mediocre as a fan of the first game and a fan of the series overall this game itself into a it 's like they did n't know what they were doing after the third chapter of the game and started writing some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down and let it i love life is strange but it should n't have a sequel max not at all the way they treated the `` '' chloe '' '' ending of the first game was horrible as well as someone who picked the `` '' arcadia '' '' option looking at the chloe stuff in this game just made me it 's such a `` '' ♥♥♥♥ you '' '' to everyone who picked that option or who just wanted to see more chloe even the game was more with it with just a small would not recommend someone this game especially with the fact that its ending is more of a part style cliffhanger than an ending save your money go find something else to play you disappointed me decknine the game game is as a a fan fan of of the the first first game game and and a fan of of the the series this game into a it 's 's like like they they did did n't n't know know what what they they were after the the third of the the game game and and let i love life is is strange strange but but it it should should n't n't have a sequel at all all the the way the `` `` '' '' '' '' ending ending of of the the first first game game was as well well as someone who the `` `` '' '' '' at the the chloe chloe stuff in this this game just made made me it 's such a `` '' '' '' '' to wanted to to see even the game was with it just a would not not recommend this game with the the fact fact that ending is more of of a a part an ending your money to play,negative
it 's just a bad game sorry i was one of the who gave true colors a review i had high hopes for deck nine 's future and they well made a of trash instead of new lis game de is awful in every in some moments it 's even to continue playing i it 's gon na be better at the beginning of every episode but it kept getting worse with all my heart with all love to this franchise i hope that deck nine will never even touch life is strange again i good deck nine i said every lis de is nearly the most boring experience out there and the worst part spoilers ahead how could make such nonsense they used lis and still messed up they had had bunch of games to off for god 's sake and still messed up i 'm a lis fan since day one and now i that the next game will never release after this trash that 's how bad it is it 's 's just just a a bad sorry i i was one of of the true colors review i i had high hopes deck nine nine 's and they made a instead of lis game de is in every in some it 's to continue it 's gon na be better at the the beginning but it with all with all to this this franchise franchise i i hope hope that that deck deck nine will never life is is strange deck nine de is the most and the the worst spoilers ahead and still messed up they had and still messed up i 'm a lis and now that the the next next game game will will never after this that 's bad it it is,negative
if you are new to lis series this is still a great visual graphics issues with amazing soundtrack but if you came from lis i you do not purchase this game and save yourself some money as this is ultimately a cringe experience with are more forced and awkward compared to previous game people still act like despite being full grown this could be as to some people ps game keeps every hours and i had to cut scenes over and over again time setting can look blurry for some people takes some to get a spoiler aside from the technical issues with the game i simply can not appreciate the fact max is so out of character in de she turns into some horny flirt with vinh and amanda when i chose to them down several times what 's the point of even giving these options when max just to act horny and do n't even get me started on did not their words when they said they will both endings in lis huge disappointment of then to get this kind of i highly doubt future episodes could save this writing will there be a twist that all the loose ends and all the out of character maybe at this point best they can do is damage control but i highly doubt the game will its i will edit my review once all episodes are released final review not worth the money there are simply too many plot holes and loose ends in the game the idea of a murder mystery through a parallel timeline is super cool but it was poorly executed `` '' que '' '' just to travel back and to information becomes no character growth de had potential it failed if you you are new to to lis lis series this is is still a great issues with but if if you from lis lis i you do do not this game game and as this this is forced and compared to previous game despite being this could could be some people hours and and i i had had to over and and over for some some people to get get a aside from from the technical issues issues with with the the game game i simply can can not the fact max is is so so out out of of character character in in de flirt with vinh and and amanda when i chose to what 's 's the the point point of do n't n't even even get get me did not when they they said said they both endings in lis to get kind of i highly save this be a all the loose ends all the out of of character at this this point they can but i i highly the game game will i will episodes are not worth worth the the money there are plot holes loose ends in the the game game the idea of a murder murder mystery but it it was poorly executed `` '' '' '' just to back and no character,negative
this game is a money grab i played the og life is strange back in when there were only two episodes released and it was in of its themes and character development however double exposure does not feel the characters are and it completely the themes and the of `` '' show do n't tell '' '' nothing means anything especially the most important decision in the previous game if you are here because you loved the og game i highly recommend against playing this this game game is is a i played played the the og life is is strange there were two episodes and it it was character development double exposure does not the characters characters are and it and the `` '' do n't '' '' especially the the most in the the previous previous game game if if you you are because you loved the the og game i i highly playing this,negative
spoilers you 're telling me i spent like on this trash i want my money back this is the biggest cash grab if i 've ever seen one caufield will return are we in the now really some parts of the game were okay in chapters but even that was ruined by the mess of that made absolutely zero sense the entirely of chapter made me just confused and i felt nothing not even any big decisions like the other games all i wanted was for the game to be over so i could do something else this just felt like the biggest f you to the rest of the games in the series and i will by the fact that life is strange is the best i even liked some of the characters in this game moses vinh but did n't appreciate that even though i picked vinh amanda was still being down my and obviously over him regardless of my choices then after chapter the romance options were with no further at least in my playthrough just what was the point instead of this they should have made something original with new characters like the other games max did n't need to come back and especially like this i feel nothing after playing unlike the emotional i felt after life is strange and the hours i spent feels like an absolute waste the only nice thing i have to say is that the game looked visually nice yet even then there were so many visual bugs especially on the loading and my kept changing no matter how many times i set it do n't play this game if you 're an actual fan of life is strange and those stories d you 're me i i spent on this i want this is is the the biggest cash grab if i i 've 've ever ever seen caufield will will return in the some parts parts of of the the game game were but even even that that was by the of that that made made me and i i felt not even like the the other other games all i i wanted for the the game game to to be so i i could this just felt like like the the biggest you to to the the rest rest of of the the games in the the series series and and i i will by the the fact fact that life is is strange strange is is the the best some of of the the characters characters in in this this game did n't that even even though though i regardless of of my chapter the the romance romance options with no at least in my my playthrough what was was the the point instead of of this they should should have have made new characters like the the other other games did n't n't need need to to come come back back and like this i feel unlike the the emotional i felt life is is strange and the hours i i spent feels like the only i have have to to say is that that the the game then there there were so many on the and my no matter many times times i do n't play this this game game if if you you 're an actual fan of of life life is is strange,negative
this game was a huge letdown it feels rushed and way too short and it ’ s poorly making the experience even worse the story lacked any real emotion and there was far too much throughout the world design was limited with barely any to explore and the characters were bland without max this game would be a she ’ s the only part worth mentioning chloe ’ s presence felt and it ’ s disappointing how the game treated her and the fans who chose her ending choices didn ’ t feel at all while chapters were really enjoyable the last two chapters were a mess with odd writing and barely any gameplay left overall a major miss this game game was was a a huge it feels rushed and way too too short short and and it it ’ ’ s making the the experience even worse the story any real and there there was too much throughout the the world to explore and the the characters characters were this game game would would be be a she ’ ’ s s the the only chloe ’ ’ s and it it ’ ’ s how the the game her and and the the fans fans who who chose didn ’ ’ t at all chapters were the last last two two chapters chapters were writing and a major,negative
if there is something in between yes and no i would chose that compared to all other life is strange games this is point last two chapters are mess rushed story and bad ending also i feel there is not much actual choice also in the whole game in general romance is forced for no reason it does n't have to do anything with a story it 's just to be there to be characters have no personality and you ca n't really read them or put yourself into their are poor there are things and game is ok but nothing special would i recommend i would say wait a sale if you like the life is strange games if there there is is something no i i would compared to to all all other other life life is is strange strange games this is last two two chapters chapters are story and also i i feel there is is not in the the whole whole game game in in general no reason reason it it does does n't n't have have to to do with a a story it 's 's just just to to be to be characters have have no and you you ca ca n't n't really them or there are game is i would a sale sale if if you like the the life life is is strange strange games,negative
its so badly to the point that if u dont have the number graphics card on the dont even trying unless u want to play with graphics worse than s motion capture ps the top graphics card will only get you around too so good x so badly to the the point that if have the on the want to to play so good,negative
one of the creators of the original life is strange wrote `` '' from what i read i think we would not have written things the same way but i felt the same with the comics and before the storm and i kind of it i ’ m pretty sure when i play the full game i wo n't recognize my characters but that ’ s also with different writers '' i do n't recognize this max caufield i do n't recognize the chloe through her text messages and other things the game is good the only con is the presence of max and the disrespect towards the original characters i am not the pricefield thing it 's okay people but the or the way the writers wrote the characters is the change does n't feel it came out of growth but rather they are just not the same characters at all you can change the and it would n't matter i felt with that ending this was not a life is strange game it just the of the original game with pretty graphics and a amazing concept but it falls flat one of of the the creators of the the original original life life is is strange `` '' from what what i i think would not not have things the the same way but but i i felt felt the the same with the the comics comics and before the the storm storm and and i kind of it i i ’ ’ m when i play the the full game i wo n't n't recognize but that that ’ ’ s s also '' i i do do n't n't recognize i do do n't n't recognize the chloe text messages and other things the the game game is is good good the the only is the of max max and and the towards the the original characters i i am am not it 's but the the way way the the writers the characters does n't n't feel out of they are are just just not not the the same at all you can change the and it it would would n't n't matter i felt that ending this was was not not a a life life is is strange strange game game it it just of the the original original game game with graphics and and a but it,negative
what was that ending was there even one what was the point nothing really got resolved at all i liked chapters but after that the writing got really bad what was that ending ending was what was was the the point at all all i but after after that that the the writing really bad,negative
might as well the choices matter nothing you do has any real the ending most of the characters are the are too short to really get to know any of them anyway deck nine seems to have forgotten that the life is strange was never about `` '' super powers '' '' but about friendship and making choices it 's major step down even from deck nine 's `` '' true colors '' '' which also failed to capture a lot of the great elements of do n't nod 's in the first two games the game like a poorly executed fan service bringing back max and giving us nothing in return but extra for cat content what a joke its a really the performances were pretty great from hannah telle especially do better d might as as well the choices choices matter you do any real the ending most of of the the characters characters are too short get to to know any of of them deck nine seems to to have that the the life life is is strange strange was was never `` '' '' '' '' but it 's deck nine nine 's `` '' true colors '' '' a lot lot of of the elements of do n't n't nod in the the first first two the game like a poorly executed fan service back max max and cat content were pretty hannah telle,negative
disrespectful to anything the first game represented bland unoriginal nostalgia bait i felt like this series started going downhill in lis and even more so in lis i thought things were looking up in lis with the environment and storytelling but damn was this a disappointment first of all do n't waste your money on the dlc it does not add very much to the story itself and i would love for these unoriginal to to save this story from being even more this was obviously extremely rushed of bugs and glitches terrible dialogue odd choices you 're basically forced to flirt with everyone and i felt no connection to any of the characters besides gwen the only character to have some character development and the of another game is insane with what also if you 're an achievement like me know that you will have to play the game at least times to be able to get all of the achievements many of them are romance based please either hand this game back to the original creators or listen to your fan base if i could rewind time and prevent myself from playing this game i would in a disrespectful to the first first game i felt felt like like this this series in lis lis and and even even more in lis lis i i thought up in in lis lis with with the was this this a a disappointment of all do n't your money on the the dlc it does does not much to to the the story and i i would to save save this this story from being even more this was bugs and choices you you 're forced to flirt with and i i felt connection to to any any of of the the characters the only to have character development and the another game game is with what if you you 're like me know that that you you will will have have to to play play the the game game at at least to be be able able to to get all of of the the achievements of them them are this game back to to the the original original creators listen to to your if i i could rewind time time and playing this this game game i i would in a,negative
so many things to like about this game but so very many more to dislike it the biggest problem is the fact that they released the game in a state and they still have n't given players as much as an of the issues you have a chance to encounter a you in the game or first into it the animations are buggy some animations do n't play some parts seem straight up unfinished or at least then there 's the issue of them the from the last game by like when the graphics almost look worse compared to true colors not to mention the issues that still are n't regardless of the `` '' fix patch '' '' could n't even the bit of optimization for this game now technical issues aside making a sequel to the original game was such a bad move when you knew both endings could n't be fully i like seeing max in this new environment and the ways in which she 's grown and changed but the game should 've been made based only on the bay ending and not both of them and speaking of changes to max there 's some that really me max is now weirdly flirty and sometimes mean and cold not at all like the awkward and yet max from the first game again this could be written off as people changing as they age but such a big shift in personality with really no for it feels weird to me the new characters introduced are mostly fun i especially like safi but i almost feel like the game could be better with a whole new protagonist and not max with max returning hannah telle makes a as the voice of max which i love but unfortunately it seems there is something truly wrong with the voice direction of the game the voice hannah telle puts on for max in this game compared to the original is very different i do n't understand why because i love hannah telle 's normal voice in and such but here she is made to speak in a low and kind of then there 's the interesting choice of bringing back before the storm chloe as the voice of chloe for the scenes instead of original life is strange chloe i guess it would be okay but because of the voice direction the performance for chloe in this game nothing like the voice she gave her in before the storm which just makes it sound like a whole different character anyway there are several things to enjoy about the game like the soundtrack a new interesting story some moments of max on the past etc but at the moment i ca n't recommend buying this game if you 're a fan of the series like me this game feels like an to the fandom in many ways if you 're new to the series this game will honestly not make a lot of sense to you since it 's so tied to the first game which is another thing why is this being as something that is very to play as your first life is strange game overall i 'd say it might be worth your money on sale if they fix the performance and visual issues but it still probably is n't worth your time so many things to to like like about about this this game game but it the the biggest is the the fact fact that that they the game game in in a and they as an of the the issues you have have a a chance in the the game it the do n't some parts at least then there there 's 's the of them from the the last last game when the the graphics compared to true colors not to to mention mention the are n't regardless of of the the `` `` '' '' '' could n't even the bit of for this this game technical issues a sequel sequel to to the the original original game game was such a a bad when you you knew both endings could n't n't be i like seeing max max in in this and the in which she 's but the the game 've been on the the bay bay ending ending and and not both of of them them and speaking of to max there 's 's some max is at all like the awkward and max from from the the first first game again this this could could be off as as they such a a big for it it feels to me me the the new new characters but i feel like like the the game game could could be be better with a a whole and not with max hannah telle as the the voice of max which i i love it seems there is is something with the the voice of the the game game the the voice hannah telle for max max in in this this game compared to to the the original is very i do do n't n't understand understand why i love love hannah hannah telle but here she is in a kind of then there there 's 's the choice of before the the storm chloe as as the the voice of chloe chloe for for the instead of original life life is is strange chloe i i guess it would because of of the the voice the performance for chloe chloe in in this this game like the the voice her in in before before the the storm like a a whole there are things to to enjoy about the the game game like like the a new of max on the the past but at at the the moment i ca ca n't n't recommend this game game if if you you 're fan of of the the series like me this game game feels feels like to the if you you 're new to to the the series this game game will make a a lot lot of to you since it it 's 's so to the the first first game game which which is why is something that that is is very to play play as first life life is is strange strange game i 'd might be worth your your money on sale sale if if they the performance issues

double exposure 's focus is too heavily on the supernatural powers it felt like watching a marvel not even the beautiful graphics and soundtrack could save this game it lacks the depth and that made us all fall in love with the first game in the franchise very disappointed with how they handled this one it felt like a on the face for the older fans it 's unfortunately a no from me even though hannah telle 's voice acting was amazing double exposure on the powers it it felt felt like not even even the graphics and save this this game game it the depth depth and that made with the the first first game game in in the the franchise very disappointed disappointed with with how how they this one it felt felt like like a on the for the it 's even though hannah telle voice acting,negative

this is a it but wait for a sale game i mean a huge sale this game is for what you get even at the base price and i 've been a big max fan since the very beginning i feel for those who for the ultimate edition when you can finish this entire game in a would that there is n't much so i ca n't even go with that excuse if you enough reviews you will see a it is easy to that these are and they would n't be happy with anything because max and chloe but that 's not true we all wanted to really really enjoy this game many aspects felt very very well thought out great some of the writing and voice acting is the best of the best but then that moment would be with a up or line that felt or rushed the longer it went on the more i i had no idea what any character would say or think next given any max that makes you feel less are just there for the the ending well i feel like a certain part was on at the end after some this ending does feel rushed we have to to that and that was a bit off and the second half is so rushed with many things so poorly explained i quite on what i was even to do not that choices seemed to matter much kinda wish they most of the story starting with the middle of episode i 'm not just talking about the main mystery but certain with characters not feeling to any of the characters or even liking most of them it 's missing a lot of character that you even with the minor characters in the first lis the whole thing seems to go from to then to all the while missing the and we came for this is is a it but wait for for a a sale game i a huge this game game is for what what you you get at the the base and i i 've 've been been a a big since the the very i feel for those those who for the the ultimate ultimate edition when you you can game in in a there is is n't so i i ca ca n't n't even with that if you you will see a it is easy to and they they would would n't max and and chloe chloe but but that that 's 's not wanted to really enjoy enjoy this this game felt very very well some of of the the writing voice acting acting is is the the best of the the best but then would be with a that felt on the i had no idea would say are just for the the ending well i i feel feel like like a a certain at the the end have to to that that and and that that was was a a bit is so what i i was to do do not seemed to most of of the the story with the the middle middle of i 'm 'm not about the the main any of of the the characters most of of them it 's a lot lot of that you with the characters in in the the first first lis the whole seems to to go all the,positive

a very mixed review i ’ ve just the game and while i have a lot of thoughts on it i ’ ll break them down into clear pros cons without any spoilers at first incredible music – without a the music in this game is the for me it the perfectly and is probably the i enjoyed most stunning visuals – the graphics are absolutely the to colors and overall design really the experience impressive facial expressions – the facial animations are emotions that make the characters feel real and new power – the new gameplay power is a fresh and something to the experience characters – the new characters are all well out with interesting most of them feel to the narrative with none coming off as or early episodes – episodes and are incredibly engaging and kept me on the of my the entire time and – while the average gameplay is around hours i spent about hours on my first playthrough to my to explore every and there ’ s to find for those who enjoy voice acting – the voice acting is with each character feeling by their voice power – while the new power is cool i felt it wasn ’ t to its full potential it could have been with more or consequences lack of meaningful choices – one of the of the life is strange series has always been the choices that you to stop and think unfortunately i didn ’ t feel most of my decisions had much impact in this game i made most choices and they didn ’ t have the weight i expected plot holes questions – this game is with unresolved plot points and story holes by the end i found myself by all the that never got up lgbtq+ representation – as a of the lgbtq+ i ’ m all for representation however in this game it feels while i appreciate having every character be part of the lgbtq+ feels a more would have been dlc – some of the you to dlcs which feel like a the dlcs like extra outfits and a cat which should have been in the base game price content – while the game ’ s graphics and design are impressive the overall experience doesn ’ t feel worth the full price i ’ d recommend waiting for a sale to get better limited – despite the stunning graphics there ’ s a lack of locations to explore the world feels smaller than i would have liked especially given the put into the design visuals sound gameplay characters overall i ’ d give this game a despite the impressive music visuals and voice acting the lack of meaningful choices and the of plot holes really it back as much as i wanted to love it the story just didn ’ t live up to i ’ d recommend this to life is strange fans but don ’ t expect it to the first game or your new favorite in the series a very i ’ the game game and and while while i i have have a a lot lot of it i i ’ ’ ll the music in this this game game is is the for me and is i enjoyed – the the graphics graphics are the experience facial expressions – the the facial facial animations make the the characters new power – the the new power is is a a fresh to the the experience – the the new new characters characters are most of of them to the the narrative narrative with off as episodes and on the of my the entire – while while the hours i to explore there ’ ’ s to find for those those who voice acting – the the voice voice acting acting is each character – while while the the new new power power is i felt wasn ’ ’ t could have have been lack of one of of the of the the life life is is strange strange series has always always been choices that you to didn ’ ’ t t feel most of of my in this this game game i and they didn ’ ’ t t have have the plot holes this game game is by the the end end i i found found myself all the as a of the i ’ ’ m in this this game game it while i i appreciate part of of the a more would have have been some of of the you to feel like like a and a have been in the the base – while while the the game ’ s graphics and the overall doesn ’ ’ t t feel worth the the full i ’ ’ d recommend waiting waiting for for a a sale to get there ’ ’ s lack of to explore i would would have into the overall i i ’ ’ d give this this game game a voice acting lack of choices and and the plot holes as much much as as i i wanted wanted to love it it the the story didn ’ ’ t up to i ’ ’ d life is is strange don ’ ’ t it to the first first game game or in the the series,positive
overall i enjoyed the game and think most fans of the series will too however it does have a good of no spoilers • this was clearly made with a limited budget which explains the game ’ s with limited choices small cast and small • the of the story is good i liked the story and how it can lead to other entries in the series however the and dialog of the story is • choices don ’ t really have any impact on the story and instead lead to some different dialog options instead of completely different scenes with the romance options to the most • there ’ s no choice s in the first game which back to the limited budget they don ’ t appear to have the to make branching which explains how they handled the of bay decision in this installment • some scenes were handled poorly and don ’ t take into some of your for example you ’ ll learn an important piece of information and in a later scene when it comes up max completely surprised like it ’ s the first time she ’ s heard it or you ’ ll see a character step outside and on their a few and talk to another character who you where said person is and max she doesn ’ t know like you can literally see that character outside the come on that ’ s just lazy • it was in the personal moments like the first game and true colors double exposure ’ s version of true colors ’ was a big step down • the are limited and very small well smaller than the previous games with only a of npcs and characters you can speak too they seem smaller and less than the first game and true colors it me of ’ s with a few npcs around and even ’ s and it just feels so in again this from a limited budget • due in part to the small the is way too easy and doesn ’ t have the of the branching outcomes like the first game • audio is the music is too out dialog but at least you can easily lower that in the settings the big problem is dialog audio which is often way too even at max settings and my to full in addition when having a max would speak clearly at a certain level and often the other s dialog would come in far too low in and with sound • the soundtrack is a big step down from the first game it ’ s not bad it ’ s just completely • there are some points where if you to a certain place it you to the next scene without and you ’ ll be to go back to complete anything you missed in the previous area you reload the last checkpoint • no which is really annoying if you want to replay the game or reload the last checkpoint if you missed something due to the • the final episode was the it seems like true where they clearly out of time money and needed to things up however it was a good setup for the next game and i like the direction the sequel appears to be going in despite its i did enjoy my time with the game and i recommend it overall i i enjoyed enjoyed the the game game and fans of of the the series however it it does have a a good this was with a limited budget the game ’ s • the of the the story story is is good good i i liked the story story and lead to in the the series however the of the the story story is don ’ ’ t impact on on the the story story and lead to instead of with the the romance romance options to the the most there ’ ’ s in the the first first game game which back to to the limited budget don ’ ’ t to have have the to make how they they handled handled the in this don ’ ’ t some of of your for example you ’ ’ ll piece of and in in a when it like it it ’ ’ s the first ’ s it or you ’ ’ ll see a a character a few talk to and max doesn ’ ’ t you can on that ’ s s just it was in the like the the first first game game and true colors double exposure ’ s version of true colors was a a big • the and very than the the previous previous games with only only a you can than the the first first game game and true colors ’ s with a a few ’ s it just limited budget to the way too doesn ’ ’ t t have have the of the like the the first first game at least you can in the the big big problem which is way too at max at a a certain the other • the the soundtrack is a a big from the the first first game game it it ’ ’ s it ’ ’ s s just there are are some if you to a a certain you to to the the next and you you ’ ’ ll to go back to in the the previous the last which is is really if you you want want to to replay replay the the game game or the last if you due to to the • the the final was the it seems out of however it it was was a a good for the the next next game game and and i i like like the the direction the sequel appears to to be i did my time with the the game game and and i recommend it,positive

this game is difficult to recommend and i would 've loved a mixed here i like many aspects of it but also many other things let me give you a list of both and then you can if this is something for you this game is a sequel to the original life is strange game which i liked a lot returning to max caulfield felt great she felt the same but older the game really takes your final choice of that game into but i did n't like what they chose for max and chloe if you chose `` '' her '' '' in the ending of the first game the rest would be story spoilers and i n't talk about any of them so here 's my list of things i liked and what i liked was the beginning of the story i really enjoyed the first three chapters before they went in a direction with chapters and that i felt mixed about the graphics look beautiful the facial animations look incredible and the characters feel alive they did a good job showing their emotions max still felt like max and her voice once again did a great job with her i also the run option so you do n't have to hold a to at a decent i also really enjoyed the at the end if you chose the chloe ending in the first life is strange game what i did n't like were quite a few things it felt like most of the choices did n't matter because they did n't have a huge impact on the story most choices also were n't very well because the of players picked one option over the other and i feel a great choice is one where people are really the game also had some boring moments that seemed to be there just to out game time but still the game is kind of short i also really how few locations there were in the game i would 've loved to see many more even though you to some of them it started to feel also in the last chapter there 's a big decision moment where you do n't get to make the decision yourself which felt strange i also think the game sometimes to a certain on the player which felt at times last but not least many are left unresolved and the last two chapters felt off and did n't carry the same emotional weight that i expect from the series as you can see i felt really mixed about this experience this is why i would 've loved a mixed option i appreciate that this game is lower it 's € instead of € like true colors but it still felt for what you get i feel like € would be a perfect price for this experience so i 'd recommend waiting for a sale before buying it all in all if i have to choose to recommend it or not i 'd say it 's worth it when it 's on sale and if you 're a huge fan of the series in the end i had enough fun with this game and coming back to max felt great i ca n't wait to see where her next journey takes her without anything i hope it on different characters or to chloe if you chose that option in the first game it 's disappointing that the beginning was solid but left me mixed by the end still i hope for the best for the series and i 'm curious about the next game this game game is and i i would would 've 've loved a mixed here i i like aspects of of it it but and then then you you can this is this game game is is a a sequel to the the original original life life is is strange strange game game which which i i liked a lot to max max caulfield the same the game of that but i i did did n't n't like what they max and and chloe if you you chose `` '' '' '' in the the ending of the the first first game game the the rest would be and i any of of them i liked what i i liked was the the beginning beginning of of the the story story i i really really enjoyed enjoyed the the first in a chapters and and that that i i felt about the the graphics the facial facial animations and the the characters they did did a a good felt like like max max and once again did a a great with her i also you do do n't have to to hold at a i also also really really enjoyed enjoyed the at the the end if you you chose chose the the chloe in the the first first life life is is strange strange game what i i did did n't n't like quite a a few it felt felt like most of of the the choices did n't they did did n't n't have have a a huge impact on on the the story very well over the the other and i i feel a great people are the game seemed to to be game time but still the game game is kind of i also also really there were in the the game game i i would would 've 've loved to see even though some of of them in the the last there 's 's a a big where you you do do n't get to to make make the i also also think think the the game a certain on the the player at times and the the last two chapters did n't the same that i from the the series series as you can can see i felt about this this is i would would 've 've loved a mixed i appreciate that this this game game is it 's instead of true colors but it for what what you you get i feel feel like would be be a for this so i i 'd recommend waiting waiting for for a a sale it all in all if i i have have to to choose recommend it it or or not i 'd say it it 's when it it 's 's on on sale and if if you you 're 're a a huge fan of of the the series in the the end end i i had with this this game game and back to to max i ca ca n't n't wait wait to to see see where i hope if you you chose in the the first first game game it it 's that the the beginning by the the end i hope for the the best for the the series and i i 'm about the the next next game,positive

this new game has an amazing soundtrack a cool new power and an interesting story i loved the first chapters but the last not so much it was disappointing there were so many plot holes and questions important aspects of the story as well as little details ’ t explained well and feel which is pretty a lot of people didn ’ t like what they did with chloe but i ’ m kind of in the middle i love her and i ’ d definitely rather she was in the game happy and with max but i also think the direction they was realistic and made sense even if it wasn ’ t what most of us wanted unlike the other life is strange games where i up or felt deeply this one the and emotional weight there were a few moments and several scenes made me how i love max 's and but overall it the emotional they always have the choices didn ’ t feel like they mattered much but i need to replay it and make different choices to see for myself if there ’ s actually much difference even though it ’ s perfect and i ’ m not sure how i feel about the direction they ’ re taking i ’ m really happy to see max again and excited for the sequel i choose to keep my up this new game has new power and an an interesting story i i loved loved the the first but the the last so much it was there were plot holes aspects of of the the story as well well as ’ t which is is pretty a lot lot of of people didn ’ ’ t what they they did with chloe chloe but but i i ’ ’ m kind of in the the middle i love her and and i i ’ ’ d she was in the the game with max but i i also also think think the the direction direction they realistic and even if if it wasn ’ ’ t most of of us unlike the the other life is is strange strange games this one there were were a a few made me how i i love max 's have the the choices didn ’ ’ t t feel feel like like they but i need to to replay it and and make to see there ’ ’ s even though though it it ’ ’ s and i i ’ ’ m not sure how i i feel about the the direction direction they ’ re i ’ ’ m to see max again for the the sequel sequel i to keep,positive

life is strange double exposure as a fan of the franchise is a game you want to love but unfortunately it makes it difficult to do so the game of the series are present in this game graphics and music of characters with you over time a focus on emotions and connection many choices that can lead to different outcomes and of course a big problem you with your one important to the player in are characters at its lis memorable characters that many of us still hold unfortunately double exposure missed the here while there is a whole of characters most of them do n't feel quite right or are n't there 's something in the way the characters look and as they went with a more realistic style etc but made the characters have strange too big for and have them be very the and often feel because there 's this they to everything some characters like safi pull and find way more and than they are it 's to watch and makes it hard to care about safi which is pretty bad considering her in this story another issue where things felt forced is the use of lis has always been towards it was a natural part of the series you could always romance you liked best and that 's still possible in lis double exposure but this time they so heavily into this that almost nothing else is left and it just felt forced every character is or a few or struggles with i 'm part of the and it 's to have representation but when your game is pretty much nothing else anymore then it does n't feel natural or believable anymore they really did too much another somewhat issue is the way are handled in this new game we got to know characters and our relationships with them evolved which made them feel believable not so much here this time we mostly just get by the game that we do like certain characters the game has already for us that we like safi and care much about her why we do n't know we just do another example the game has started and we like amanda the really much despite not her and our objective is now to to ask her for a and do lines on her we did n't even have any interactions with her yet but she 's supposed to be our main love interest in this game the only excuse for this is that this is one of amanda 's personal struggles liking people too much too but let 's be real it 's mostly lazy writing same with or gwen the game heavily us towards liking them and caring about them but why is annoying and on a person who 's not single all game and to another character 's why would we like her one of the few in the game that felt natural was the to moses as it grew over time as we got to know him more this made sense amanda did have one or two moments later on that to a real reason we might like her too although they it too hard in the beginning but in a way it felt like all in this game were by the despite of those characters being unlikable or shallow sad was that the game chloe and arcadia bay times in the game but we never get to see her in person which considering the abilities characters in the game have could easily have been put into the game maybe something they to do in the next part hopefully another problem was how little our choices seem to have this time around sure we make our choices but the outcome feels more due to them certain parts to set up a sequel this down the of our choices in the first lis our decisions were hard and meaningful we had to choose between our best or a whole of people and we could n't have it both in the lis about the two our choices what kind of person our little would into and which of us would even but this time around both final choices are to pretty much the same with only minor the story feels okay but the just do n't feel high and decisions do n't make enough of a difference lis 's was and double exposure to in its something went really in the of the final chapter we 're in the middle of the final it 's up we 're trying a few small things and suddenly well suddenly our character something along the lines of `` '' i 'm so we it all '' '' and everything is fine i was and thought this must be a of our main character before we get to the actual resolution of the there just is no end at all it 's just over without us doing anything or making a choice everything is suddenly okay everyone and all that is for nothing and to set up a at that once that weight to two unlikable people from this part that was so visuals sound gameplay characters story as a whole this game is the of getting and being `` '' that must 've been the best o you ever had '' '' but you did n't even come sure the game experience overall was still and sometimes fun but there 's a lot to about it too and ultimately you 're getting of a proper for fans of the series i think it 's still worth playing but it does n't hold a to the first few games still better than true colors though i hope the sequel does better than double exposure if you buy it the base version is the best option maybe you can get the on sale later on i the ultimate version and while like the cat outfits etc are they really do n't the price life is is strange strange double double exposure as a a fan fan of of the the franchise is a a game game you you want want to to do of the the series in this this game graphics and of characters choices that lead to different outcomes and of of course a big big problem the player of us double exposure there is is a a whole of characters most of of them do n't n't feel are n't there 's in the the way way the the characters as they with a a more the characters and have there 's like safi they are it 's hard to to care care about which is is pretty in this this story is the use of of lis has always always been it was was a part of of the the series you could and that that 's 's still in lis double exposure but this this time nothing else and it it just just felt a few i 'm part of of the and it it 's to have game is is pretty pretty much nothing else it does does n't n't feel too much issue is is the the way in this this new got to to know characters and with them so much this time by the the game game that the game game has like safi safi and do n't n't know just do the game game has her and for a did n't n't even with her she 's supposed to to be in this this game game the for this this is is that that this this is one of too much let 's it 's the game on a 's not game and like her one of of the in the the game game that that felt was the as it as we got to to know on that like her in the the beginning but in in a a way way it it felt felt like in this this game by the that the the game chloe and arcadia bay in the the game game but get to to see her in considering the characters in in the the game have been into the the game to do in the the next our choices seem to to have this time time around our choices but the the outcome due to certain parts set up up a a sequel down the our choices in the the first first lis to choose a whole of people could n't n't have in the the lis about the the two our choices kind of of us but this this time time around choices are pretty much the same with only the story but the just do do n't n't feel do n't of a double exposure in the of the the final we 're in the the middle middle of of the the final it 's we 're a few along the of `` `` '' i 'm it all '' '' everything is i was be a get to to the the actual of the at all it 's 's just everything is all that set up up a that was as a a whole this game game is is the `` '' 've been the best '' '' you did did n't n't even the game and sometimes there 's 's a a lot about it you 're of a a proper fans of of the the series i think think it it 's 's still but it it does does n't to the the first better than true colors though i i hope the sequel better than double exposure if you buy it it the the base the best you can can get on sale the ultimate and while like the do n't,positive
early access thoughts i loved the original life is strange game i even enjoyed before the games are fantastic however double exposure falls short in the of the first two the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ part is how they handled max an entire for chloe and yet they had chloe break up with max through a that just does n't feel true to their relationship even if they were going through a chloe ’ t just give up and leave that said if you set aside that double exposure has a lot going for it the graphics are stunning and the facial animations are some of the best i ’ ve seen the story is engaging with a solid cast of characters but i just didn ’ t feel a strong connection to safi who you ’ re supposed to care about the most she doesn ’ t have the same emotional pull that chloe had in the original game it almost feels like max wasn ’ t meant to be the protagonist this time around however with three more chapters on the way i ’ m that the game will these issues and chloe and max double exposure has some strong with certain parts of the story being genuinely enjoyable however too many plot points felt unresolved the story an feel it ’ s clear they ’ re setting up for a dlc or sequel but this focus on future content from a conclusion the ending felt almost as if it ended the story feeling just unlike the first life is strange games i ’ t find myself truly caring about most of the characters gwen and moses out as but the rest didn ’ t really with me the game seemed to for a connection with safi as if trying to replace chloe as max ’ s best friend but she came as a forced and don ’ t even get me started on safi basically trying to the life is strange i also am to bring up which still ’ t max and chloe this lack of around their relationship only to my with safi and the romance options here as i still believe max and chloe should never have been up because it makes no sense for chloe to just max because she ’ s a `` '' free '' '' but enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and about how bad double exposure is there are some good aspects here hannah telle ’ s performance as max caulfield is incredible she truly in the of this game and is the main reason i with it to complete the game to the end max caulfield will always be one of my favorite characters and hannah telle ’ s is a huge part of what makes her great the graphics are fantastic with each feeling and real the voice acting is superb as well the entire cast did a fantastic job but i could say a whole lot more but then this would be a book so all things i would this game about a and if i 'm being a i honestly to say it because i wanted to like this game but i don ’ t think they can the that the original life is strange games had so if you 're a fan or someone who liked chloe i would say save your money because you probably n't enjoy this game however if you ’ re a new fan or didn ’ t like chloe you might find it enjoyable but it ’ s still better to wait for a sale i loved loved the the original original life life is is strange strange game double exposure of the the first first two the most part is how they they handled an entire chloe and they had up with with max through a does n't n't feel even if if they through a ’ t if you double exposure has a a lot it the the graphics graphics are and the the facial facial animations are some some of of the the best i ’ the story story is with a of characters but i i just didn ’ ’ t t feel to safi you ’ ’ re supposed to to care care about about the the most doesn ’ ’ t t have have the the same in the the original original game game it it almost feels like like max wasn ’ ’ t to be the protagonist this time time around on the the way way i i ’ ’ m that the the game chloe and and max double exposure has some with certain certain parts parts of of the the story the story it ’ ’ s ’ re setting up for a but this the ending as if if it the story unlike the the first first life life is is strange strange games ’ t most of of the the characters but the the rest didn ’ ’ t the game seemed to for a with safi as if trying to as max ’ s as a don ’ ’ t trying to the life life is is strange i also ’ t max and and chloe lack of with safi safi and and the the romance romance options as i i still max and and chloe have been because it ’ s a `` `` '' '' '' double exposure exposure is there are are some hannah telle ’ s as max max caulfield in the of this this game game and and is is the the main with it it to the game game to to the the end max caulfield one of of my my favorite characters and hannah telle ’ s is a a huge part of of what great the the graphics graphics are the voice voice acting acting is as well the entire did a a fantastic but i i could a whole but then would be be a i would this game and if if i i 'm a i say it i wanted wanted to this game game but but i don ’ ’ t that the the original original life life is is strange strange games so if if you you 're 're a someone who i would would say your money enjoy this this game if you you ’ ’ re a new didn ’ ’ t but it it ’ ’ s wait for for a a sale,positive

a into the franchise that 's sometimes and sometimes hot the in the pros graphics the look photo realistic and acting from all characters really cool character d all new characters are just so well written and make you really want to know what 's coming next new love are just so cool power is pretty cool but really would have been a better addition to her old powers i that both and deck to use the powers as they were a part of what made lis a games had already that other in universe people have powers besides max and cons writing most of chapter had me the scene just felt so forced like they 're trying to make you like safi but it 's just so is a well written character but they tell you max and her are rather than showing you as such a part of the emotional impact of later scenes up missing the game about a still does n't have a photo and with a game this gorgeous it one few locations you really just back and between where max a and the university very very little branching out and while the graphics are gorgeous the is a bit especially if you live in the least one major character from early game just never to be again for no good reason spent so much time at max some of her decisions in game and to in the past old are just and sometimes when you the player should be able to make a decision you ca n't ending not spoilers conclusion a fantastic and heavily game i 'm not sure i like the direction the franchise is but this game right now is good end scene spoiler into the the franchise that 's and sometimes in the new characters characters are are just just so well written and make make you you really want to to know are just just so power is is pretty pretty cool would have have been been a to her as they were a part of of what max and and cons most of just felt like they they 're trying to to make make you like safi but it it 's 's just just so is a well written max and rather than such a part of of the does n't n't have have a with a a game you really and the out and and while while the the graphics graphics are is a a bit especially if if you in the to be so much at max some of of her game and in the are just and sometimes when you the player should be able to to make make a ca n't a fantastic game i i 'm 'm not not sure i like like the the direction the franchise but this this game right now is good,positive
good story stunning visuals top and incredible soundtrack as usual playing as max and seeing her after feels pretty amazing honestly so if you 're a fan of original lis i think this one 's for you the story is not something `` '' out of this world '' '' but it 's fun and very this game really made my inner fan feeling things and i ca n't wait to see more of max in the future good story as usual playing as as max max and so if if you you 're 're a a fan fan of original lis i think think this this one the story story is is not `` '' out of of this '' '' but it it 's fun and and very this game and i i ca ca n't n't wait wait to to see more of of max in the the future,positive

producto recibido de forma gratuita life is strange mixed feelings you can see that the developers their best a pretty cool plot idea a very good soundtrack atmosphere graphics are great characters are well written not perfect but it will do cool with but i did not like the idea of a sequel to the original lis i think the first part is a complete finished work and this game feels like same to the endings in the first lis there were two endings and although each player was free to choose between them i the ending where max and chloe away together for me at least in this game you can kind of change some details that are to the endings of the original game but it does n't change much the plot of this game will and the difference is in small details i have the feeling that the game was more for the fact that people chose to and many elements of this game elements like as if more to a certain that the developers chose also at the end of this game we have two endings which slightly and that 's it everything remains the same the characters from the choice of ending do not change in any way the choices throughout the game do not affect anything safi for example and considering that the developers at the end that max will we are waiting for the up of this story i have that it will feel like an “ ” and that the decisions in this game which we made will slightly affect the events of the “ sequel ” i would like to note that so far there are minor bugs in the game and there was up take in one dialog i have only mixed feelings about the game the developers to come up with something but it turned out to be quite to the game in life is strange double exposure is a good game if you it in from the whole series but if you it as a part of the series it is quite producto recibido recibido de de forma forma gratuita life is is strange mixed feelings you can can see that the the developers pretty cool a very very good graphics are are great characters are are well well written but it it will but i did not like the of a a sequel to the the original original lis i think think the the first part is is a this game feels like to the the endings endings in in the the first first lis there were two endings to choose the ending max and and chloe for me at least in this this game game you you can kind of that are to the the endings of the the original original game game but but it it does does n't the plot of this this game and the i have have the that the the game game was for the the fact fact that chose to to and of this this game as if to a a certain that the the developers at the the end end of of this this game two endings and that that 's the same the characters from the do not way the the choices throughout the the game do not for example that the the developers at the the end that max max will waiting for for the of this this story story i i have that it it will feel like and that that the the decisions in this this game game which of the i would like to so far there are in the the game game and and there there was in one i have mixed feelings feelings about about the the game game the the developers up with but it to be the game game in life is is strange strange double double exposure exposure is is a a good good game game if if you from the the whole series but but if if you as a part of of the the series it is is quite,positive
double exposure left me on the one hand it is beautiful and makes good use of a great soundtrack the dialog is well written and the voice acting generally superb after my at the of chloe from the game aside from and the of max 's powers into universe hopping rather than time travel i wanted to with the new cast of characters max 's two choices of love interest and see how jumping between two could affect the narrative and the outcome of the game on the other hand despite some really great and dialog i found the actual story to be for the of the game though the dialog is well written almost all of that is not only max 's dialog it is her her inner thoughts that no one but the player this an experience those new powers that seemed so promising felt quite limited and like they to a series of and those new characters felt shallow even more so over the course of the game because all that universe hopping meant that i was really only half the time at best with any one version of them they had no of any of the very few meaningful interactions i 'd had with them once i making the of real feeling relationships impossible ultimately it did n't feel like max 's powers had any real impact on the outcome of the story did they leave me with the that i 'd really that journey i did n't feel like i 'd made my version of max that the endings that all these games to have unlike say in lis true colors where i felt like i 'd my own version of i found this older version of max much more sympathetic and immediately than the original version of the original lis game this max is by her past and has matured enough to understand that there are some things you just have to in life she feels like she 's been through a which is certainly especially if you chose to save chloe in the first game and let arcadia bay be literally away however this max is still an she 's still a despite both her and the story us that she has at caledon college where chloe acted as a to max life and fun and into that first story there is n't a character to do that for max here sure there 's moses but he 's just as much of an as she is even she 's left two of him even when she her universe hopping abilities in him it 's not at all like when max her abilities with chloe which triggers a series of moments a deal in of max 's lack of impact is safi death triggers the whole story i felt like i got to know safi and i have to say that i did n't like her her death was a to me with only max 's to it making me feel much of anything about it in the original lis max never even rachel who is the big of that story but through chloe 's feelings about rachel and chloe being a more sympathetic and generally interesting character i came to care about what had happened to rachel i never really all that much about what happened to safi which is a big problem since her death triggers the entire double exposure story even more is that even though max to be by safi 's death she almost no time with safi once she that she can between the timeline in which safi was and a second timeline where safi is still alive for a chapter and a half i grew annoyed that max did n't out safi and every possible second with her because max should already have that everything is and comes with a price especially in to her powers in fact she even that there 's always a price at least once but seems to her own i do have several of double exposure and it certainly is n't my favorite game in the series that would be true colors for the way the powers connection with the characters as to how the powers max from everyone in double exposure by them all into two shallow i still enjoyed my time at caledon college for my max is and sympathetic enough that i ultimately did feel for her by the end of the story even if none of the other characters mattered to me i certainly understand people this game a though because the developers it or not double exposure seemed unlike the original lis or true colors which were all about the protagonist to another or several others in true colors through the use of their powers and as as it might have been for the experience double exposure on the the one it is use of of a a great is well well written and the the voice voice acting at the from the the game aside from and the of max max 's universe hopping rather than time travel i wanted wanted to with the new cast of characters max 's between two the narrative and the the outcome of the the game on the the other i found found the the actual to be for the of the the game is well well written all of of that is not not only only max max 's it is her inner but the the player like they new characters even more over the of the the game all that universe hopping that i i was was really the time time at at best version of of them they had any of of the the very i 'd with them once i it did did n't n't feel feel like like max max 's impact on on the the outcome of the the story with the that i i 'd i did did n't n't feel feel like like i i 'd version of of max these games to have in lis true colors i felt felt like like i i 'd my own version of i found version of of max than the the original version of of the the original original lis max is enough to that there there are are some have to feels like she 's through a which is especially if if you you chose chose to in the the first first game game and and let arcadia bay max is is still she 's 's still still a her and and the the story that she at caledon as a to max fun and into that there is is n't a character to do there 's he 's 's just just as as much much of as she she is she 's universe hopping it 's 's not at all when max with chloe of max max 's lack of the whole story i i felt felt like like i got to to know safi and and i i have have to say that that i i did did n't like her her death was a to me with only only max max 's much of about it in the the original original lis is the the big of that story but feelings about and chloe a more character i to care care about happened to never really all that that much happened to to safi which is is a a big big problem her death the entire double exposure even more is that even though to be safi 's with safi that she between the and a a second safi is is still for a chapter and and a that max did n't safi and with her everything is with a to her that there there 's at least seems to i do double exposure and it is n't my favorite game in in the the series would be true colors for the the way way the with the the characters how the in double double exposure i still still enjoyed my time time at at caledon max is that i for her by the the end end of of the the story even if of the the other other characters to me this game game a the developers it or or not double exposure unlike the the original original lis true colors about the the protagonist true colors use of as it might have have been for the the experience,positive
the first two chapters are very enjoyable for those who are of i 'll list some pros and cons that i personally pros spoiler free the game is visually great and i love the expressions of the characters though i do i miss the style of the old game a bit the seem realistic and a bit less than the previous games though even without the i believe the of max is very well the story so far has been incredibly interesting to the point i have n't thinking about it and i want to replay the first two chapters over and over to see all the different outcomes i feel like all decisions carry weight in your gameplay not just the more `` '' '' '' choices cons spoiler free i have encountered some fps mostly during scenes though there have been a issues during such as are missing for and one of the characters for a moment lol on the side this is n't the of game where lag the again with the graphics i 've the shadows are the most setting and yet there 's only a few settings for medium high i 'd love if a `` '' low '' '' setting could be in the future as the performance with no shadows is yet incredibly to look at now i 'll some pros and cons that spoilers so avoid this next if you 've not played the game or gameplay overall i 'm with this game and would definitely recommend it the rest of the chapters can hold up to the first two the first first two two chapters chapters are for those those who i 'll and cons that i the game game is great and and i i love love the of the the characters though i i do miss the of the the old game a a bit realistic and and a a bit than the the previous previous games of max max is very well the story so far has been to the the point i have about it it and and i want to to replay replay the the first first two two chapters to see all the different outcomes i feel feel like `` '' '' '' i have have been been a one of of the the characters for a on the this is is n't n't the with the the graphics i 've the most there 's 's only only a a few i 'd a `` `` '' '' '' in the the future as the the performance now i i 'll and cons if you you 've played the the game game or overall i i 'm with this this game game and recommend it the rest rest of of the up to to the the first first two,positive

life is strange double exposure is a mixed that has some interesting and a promising start but ultimately to live up to the potential of its and of trying to the narrative of the series in to a direction that at least i am not too excited about while it was great to be playing as max caulfield again i have to that there were multiple moments i found myself thinking that the story they could have also just an original character instead as it felt that the were more interested in using max as a character than the were interested in writing about max as a character that being said i did enjoy episodes to just that and were n't great the gameplay never really evolved or the times in an interesting way and overall the whole thing was a mixed do i think it is worth playing why not it is not a disaster but i would absolutely recommend waiting for a sale life is is strange strange double double exposure exposure is is a a mixed that has has some and a up to to the trying to the narrative of the the series to a at least i am not too it was to be playing as as max max caulfield i have have to that there there were i found found myself that the the story could have also just as it it felt felt that that the were more interested in max as as a a character than the interested in max as as a a character said i i did just that that and great the never really an interesting the whole was a a mixed i think think it it is it is is not not a but i i would recommend waiting waiting for for a a sale,positive
as a chloe the and play this yes you 'll miss her and yes it 's a little starting off i think it on its slightly in the beginning that just having max will get and keep our interest rather than to it but it 's also worth as episodes and in are characters the plot had me hooked what started as i 'll finish episode turned into an to finish it because it was just that the animations and va in were top really gorgeous and there was some fantastic to i wish they would down the and of lines and make them player but that 's a i had a fantastic playing this deck nine has my trust as a you 'll her and it 's 's a off i i think think it in the the beginning max will rather than but it it 's episodes and and in the plot i 'll because it it was was just just that and there there was i wish they would down the but that that 's 's a i had had a a fantastic deck nine,positive
as a time lis fan i 'm gon na be and say this is easily the one though i really enjoy the new characters and the overall story gwen is so hot i the journal none of it looks like something max would ever seeing how this is after the original it would only make sense that her would 've instead of going down the weird off looking she is doing now i 'm also deeply by the colors and choices i when max picked up the and said `` '' its my '' '' no like that i 'm not saying it has to be actually but its like they did n't even try to make it look like it one of my favorite part of the games is through the and reading every single to truly myself in the world of the protagonist which is why is so lol the previous games have all the and i think its major part of the franchise so it up this bad is i would also like to how lazy the area felt it beautiful but with it made me i did not like the and though it all i know its in the beginning of the game and maybe meant to new players into the but my main is definitely the journal though and i think my is pros max is back final outfits cat hot i also really enjoy the it 's a lis and they are got keep the alive shaka keep in that i only played the first two episodes so far so i 'm hoping i can see past the `` '' '' '' and just enjoy how the story i 'll just have to wait around hours for the full game to be out as a i 'm gon na this is though i i really really enjoy enjoy the the new new characters characters and and the the overall is so of it this is after the the original it would that her would 've instead of down the she is now i i 'm by the when max `` '' '' '' that i i 'm 'm not to be like they they did did n't n't even to make make it like it one of of my my favorite part of of the in the of the the protagonist which is is so the previous previous games and i i think part of of the the franchise i would like to with it made me i did did not like the though it it all i know in the the beginning beginning of of the the game game and into the and i i think max is is back i also also really really enjoy enjoy the it 's 's a they are that i i only only played played the the first first two two episodes so far so i i 'm i can can see `` '' '' '' and just how the the story i 'll have to for the the full full game game to to be,positive
i can understand people being annoyed at the fact that the game does n't both endings but aside from that fact i want to put my piece down so far point one from the three hours i 've played so far i 'm really enjoying how they 're setting up plot the max clearly has i felt lis from the very moment i the the music and max is back made me up point two as much as i 'm loving this game so far i ca n't that once again is with how well i can run the game i 'm getting lag the is going all over the place and it 's hard to keep fps point three i 've been reading that both endings would be but from the first it appears to of that i can understand the in that but i 'm enjoying this so far it 's got me hooked and this is someone who did n't play lis or true colours as they did n't interest me at all if you really liked life is strange you 'll love this game if you can get over the fact the that only one of the endings in lis appears to be at this moment in time i will update my review if such a thing later i can at the the fact fact that that the the game does n't aside from want to so far from the hours i i 've 've played so far far i i 'm how they they 're setting up i felt from the the very the music max is is back made me as much much as as i i 'm this game game so so far far i i ca ca n't once again with how well i i can can run the game game i i 'm is going over the and it it 's hard to to keep i 've 've been would be from the the first appears to that i i can in that but i i 'm so far it 's hooked and this is someone who did n't true colours as they they did did n't at all if you you really life is is strange you 'll this game game if if you you can can get over the the fact one of of the the endings endings in in lis appears to to be i will my review such a,positive
this was pretty much everything i had it was i really enjoyed playing through this game it had a good story really characters and some not and max was just as as she was in the first game i know it 's getting a lot of reviews based on how chloe does n't appear in the games but as someone who chose to save arcadia bay in the first lis having her appear would have been really weird i do love how max about her a lot though even though chloe does n't appear you can tell how important she still is to max i also felt the new powers were a fun change and it made dealing with certain parts of the story more interesting seeing how low the are for this game currently makes me sad i feel like it much more than it 's getting i 'm looking to a continuation to max 's story again in the future this was pretty much i had it was i really really enjoyed this game game it had a a good good story characters and and some and max was just just as as she she was in the the first first game game i i know it 's a lot lot of based on does n't in the someone who chose to arcadia bay in the the first first lis would have have been i do a lot even though does n't you can to max i also the new were a and it with certain certain parts parts of of the the story for this this game i feel feel like like it it 's i 'm to a to max max 's in the the future,positive
spoilers double exposure is an interesting game if you 're a or someone that found the relationship between her and max to be a of your of the first game then you should probably this if you 're interested in just more max it 's a good if you 're looking for an narrative with and believable character de 's main often with its animations and good va work are often by unclear character and a mystery that is by people 's to actually speak clearly to max taking of the two you can back and between most of max 's time at caledon is down someone for information and nothing of use then to the timeline and and information that them to give you something -- a fact or at an but anything to go off of until the end of the game most of the at caledon seem to be of the most in between gwen lucas and yasmin you have three for the of for poorly explained reasons her book deal is cancelled because yasmin wanted it to be for reasons something to safi 's character and a for her decisions is never explained to max i yasmin was just her from being a lucas and gwen are n't much better lucas never takes his and to maya 's even more by the end of the game he 's it off with a and acting as if he 's away with it despite it a disaster for him just the past chapter gwen is just weird you have this things my own way character safi 's book deal up this interesting and somewhat for why someone especially a to safi would do such a thing but it into gwen was to do it by yasmin and along with it despite at any other point in the game talking to max how she 's of for herself at the college why she does this at all or why she even to yasmin in the first place is never explained because instead of getting a resolution with her like everyone else she out and lastly safi herself is a real piece of work jumping from an and acting those who her to someone suddenly having a and herself as a half the game i that safi lucas and his relationship with his son to get back at her for maya 's -- instead when max her about this she it off and says `` '' i thought he might have had something with my cancelled book deal '' '' actually then you have a with lucas to safi because suddenly she that she 's supposed to actually care about maya which in safi that her is actually down of `` '' of the '' '' she actually is the one that cancelled safi 's book deal why reasons reasons that explains to you or max in fact the best of the game is the most minor and wasted character ever alderman a detective in the is to the murder or of safi despite only into the game in chapter and making a mostly wasted in early chapter alderman is played off as a and most of all character from him max change aspects of reality to his way into her home and that her entire past is a story of death it 's clear that alderman is the first to he 's dealing with a unfortunately this is immediately wasted as alderman from after serious too it 's literally right after the scene and it 's such a of a character as the idea of a detective and clear enough to keep on max 's and know that something strange and is is a idea wasted detective alderman definitely could have the death note lastly i know a lot of people are annoyed with the of chloe in this game as well as max 's relationship with her but i think this has left people a far more curious at the end of the game max into the storm safi to two impossible choices chloe or her in the first game despite any of with the first game max actually to everything and save the that the storm is n't actually a really it 's more like a minor which i that max will just time travel back to using the photo she kept the storm and save both chloe and arcadia right probably not game would vinh and the again double exposure exposure is an interesting game if if you you 're 're a found the her and and max to be be a of your of the the first first game then you if you you 're interested in it 's 's a a good if you you 're narrative with and a to max of the the two you can most of of max max 's time at at caledon to the to go until the the end end of of the the game most of of the at caledon seem to to be of the the most lucas and you have for the book deal it to to be to safi safi 's 's character and a for her to max was just lucas and are n't even more by the the end end of of the the game he 's with a as if he 's with it is just you have my own safi 's book deal to safi such a thing but but it to do with it point in in the the game to max she 's at the at all in the the first instead of with her out and is a piece of those who as a the game game i lucas and to get when max about this `` '' might have with my book deal '' '' then you you have have a that she she 's supposed to care about that her of `` `` '' of the '' '' is the the one safi 's book deal the best of the the game game is is the the most in the into the the game game in chapter and off as as a most of aspects of that her is a it 's is the the first he 's with a this is it 's after the and it it 's such a of a a character as the of a enough to to keep on max max 's is a could have i know a lot lot of of people people are with the in this this game as well well as as max max 's with her but i i think think this at the the end end of of the the game into the the storm her in in the the first first game with the the first first game that the the storm is n't it 's like a which i that max max will time travel back to the storm chloe and,positive
i got the advanced access so i only have access to and played the first two chapters pros are a much needed over the last games max looks great but looks alot different which i could see being an issue for some people usual for the life is strange games chapter left off on a huge moment and made me eager to play the next chapters when the full game releases characters are more to like and memorable than true colors i honestly only and the other two main characters from true colors the other characters in that game were pretty and i found myself not caring for them that much so far in double exposure there are maybe only a i do n't really care for new power system they have for the game is pretty cool i actually it over the or reading the previous game had of the dialogue choices needed more when them there were a good of times where something came off alot then how i thought it was gon na come off i know life is strange has always dialogue this way but this was the first time its actually kinda me enough to it can to dialogue and some of it will actually have things you can do that will up at the end of the chapter when you your choices to what other people make the problem is that this dialogue is pretty for example i got too far away by and the dialogue it would not play anymore and i had to reload a checkpoint to get it to play again i needed to do this because to the whole dialogue would something for me to do there is also way to long of between when two npcs are talking together if you 've played think of the long that have when talking to each other i know the life is strange series has always had but there were of moments were i my example being max saying she the of the outside the and says something about the like is that really necessary there was also another moment where you can see a of the last three are a man a man and a in that if you with the max says something along the lines of `` '' way to be a '' '' i may be reading into that too much but given the in the us it would n't me if it was more than just a as before i currently only have access to and have played the first two chapters so i think it would be to give this game a as of now that being said i enjoyed the first two chapters and eager to play the full release i 'll update this review if i feel like i need to anything after i finish the game when it fully releases i just finished the game ending was great and it set up future games very well pretty with the direction they 're taking the story in i just hope they it advanced access so i i only only have have access access to to and played the the first first two two chapters are a over the the last which i i could for some some people for the the life life is is strange strange games on a a huge made me eager to to play play the the next the full full game characters are are more true colors the other true colors the other other characters characters in in that and i i found found myself that much so far in double double exposure there are only a i do do n't n't really new power they have for the the game game is is pretty pretty cool over the the previous of the the dialogue there were were a a good how i it was gon na off i i know life is is strange has always but this this was was the the first enough to and some some of of it it will you can at the the end end of of the when you your choices make the is that that this is pretty for example and the the dialogue it would and i i had to get get it it to to play to do to the the whole for me to do there is way to if you you 've 've played of the to each i know the life life is is strange strange series has always there were of the about the is that there was where you you can can see see a the last are a and a in that if you with the along the of `` `` '' way to to be be a '' '' into that too much in the it would would n't if it it was just a only have have access access to to and and have played the the first first two two chapters so i i think think it it would would be give this this game game a now that said i i enjoyed enjoyed the the first first two two chapters chapters and eager to to play play the the full full release i 'll if i i feel feel like like i need to the game when it i just finished the the game ending was great and and it set up very well with the the direction direction they they 're the story i just,positive

as an older i do not really care about other players issues with the plot lack of decisions from lis max is back i love her she is a but still is and yet and curious i only played part i and as a and i like the new to time travel the important decisions were unexpected enough so i the first parts to be more in with max and not only with my of what is right or because it is unclear very unclear in the beginning new characters are well written yet me a serious of while making decisions the plot seems promising and as dark as we can expect of lis franchise graphics are more realistic the style and looks amazing though i lis there were a few bugs but it is fine for a fresh release more hours for the full release love it love it love it i do miss chloe max as much as you very much to everyone who my review and even unexpected but you are too kind even those who a lot to as an i do do not care about with the the plot lack of max is is back i love she is is a but still i only only played as a and i i like like the the new time travel so i the first to be with max max and not only with my of what because it it is in the the beginning new characters characters are are well well written the plot as we of lis graphics are are more though i there were were a a few but it it is for a a fresh for the the full full release love it love it love it i do max as as much much as my review you are those who a lot,positive
note i played this game on deck and despite it not being it was without any issues at all advanced access review a proper continuation to the original life is strange this game the player to once again take of max now an in her max is at a university and has been the of her friend safi when safi is suddenly max a new power this time she is not limited to time but can between different and timelines in one safi is and in the other safi is still alive but max must for in both timelines to the killer from again only in advanced access right now i 've only played the first two chapters with the final not coming out until the end of the however this game has a lot of and because of the way it handled chloe spoiler about chloe but nothing else now that the chloe is out of the way this game is a killer they made it dark with and unlikable characters somewhat to the original game you do n't truly know or what they 're of and everyone has a `` '' bad '' '' side that max is to and learn more about we 're talking dealing and of course the murder mystery over our you do n't know who you can trust and you come to find that you ca n't even trust yourself they the killer early on at the end of chapter and let me just say that the is and really the game as being good and the plot being i 'm hooked and i think its so far the best mystery out of any lis game of course the original after the game i would say that it its atmosphere throughout much of the game the ended up having some issue in chapter and there was a during the chapter that has ended up some however i that it is an enjoyable edition to the lis franchise and is a top for me this game a dark and atmosphere with often characters it the of set on a with games and power struggles it 's every man for and max is out of her trying to make since of this world as she a new mystery and a evolved power this game it was at all advanced access a proper to the the original original life life is is strange this game the player once again of max max is at a has been of her safi is a new new power this time she is is not in one safi is and in in the the other safi is is still advanced access right now now i i 've 've only only played played the the first first two two chapters with the the final until the the end end of of the this game game has a lot lot of of the the way way it chloe but nothing else now that that the the chloe is out out of of the the way this game game is is a to the the original original game game you you do do n't what they they 're has a a `` `` '' '' '' that max max is we 're and of of course murder mystery you do do n't n't know you can and you to find that you ca n't n't even at the the end end of chapter and and let say that that the the game good and and the the plot i 'm hooked and and i i think so far far the the best out of of course the original the game game i i would would say say that that it much of of the the game game the chapter and and there there was was a during the that has that it it is to the the lis and is is a for me this game on a games and it 's and max max is is out out of of her trying to to make of this as she a new and a,positive
i was how they could continue max 's story from the very first game they to her story in i did n't even think about the graphics were beautiful the story was so good and i was to each character i to this is well worth the money if you are into with choices along the way i 'm excited to see where this story could lead next give this a you regret it i was how they max 's from the the very first game to her her story i did did n't n't even about the the graphics the story story was good and and i i was to each each character character i this is is well worth the if you you are along the the way way i i 'm excited to to see see where this story give this,positive
they put max 's into the game without max which we know is good to play but i would also like to see chloe the story is interesting and in some but i could n't understand why other people did n't like it i hope they will the if chloe was max 's into the the game is good to play but i i would like to to see the story story is but i i could could n't did n't n't like like it it i i hope,positive
the game out and me right back into that very life is strange feeling however the performance is i know that my pc is n't the but it 's decent yet i have to play on on middle setting with around fps i 'd like to play at like at least or so but going lower on the settings makes the game look like a enough if i the game it runs at around fps so if you have a similar pc and have everything on middle but it runs try it the game into that life is is strange however the the performance i know is n't n't the but it it 's i have have to to play i 'd like to to play at least on the the game like a if i the game game it it runs so if if you you have have a and have but it it runs,positive
i loved the episodes i played even if it is different and things have i mean it ‘ s just life can ‘ t wait for the other episodes to play the graphics are amazing and i love the characters i loved loved the even if if it it is s just ‘ t wait for for the the other to play play the the graphics graphics are are amazing amazing and and i i love love the the characters,positive
i 'm very with this game the first chapters are incredibly good the music and writing is amazing max 's character for the most part is really well written feeling like herself but matured and a lot of the characters are well written and acted and interesting to learn more about it is however an incredibly game i for one do n't have a problem with how they the chloe to with them being up actually makes alot of sense especially with some of the they have about why but they never really as to the actual and it almost feels her up at all at that point it seems like they wanted max 's character to be by the decision but never to doing so aside from that the story falls short incredibly with the last chapters the writing feels poorly and at times is just very and although i enjoyed the game it did feel not great after getting to the end and tbh the way the game is setup you do n't really get to safi so the ending just feels kinda at best and unfortunately kinda you thinking `` '' what was the point '' it 's really hard for me to this i think if you get it on sale and enjoy life is strange it 's worth a playthrough but other than that i 'm not sure i could conclusion max as a character feels and if you want more of max you will have a great time the parts that are great really out unfortunately the parts that are poorly written make it hard to the good and just you feeling sad for what could have been i 'm with this this game game the the first first chapters chapters are max 's 's character for the the most part is is really well written and a a lot lot of of the the characters characters are are well well written to learn about it it is game i for one do n't n't have have a with how how they the chloe with them some of of the they have never really to the the actual and it it almost at all it seems like they max 's 's character to be by the aside from that the the story with the the last the writing at times is just i enjoyed enjoyed the the game game it it did to the the end the way way the the game game is you do do n't n't really to safi the ending at best `` '' was the the point it 's for me i think if you you get get it on sale life is is strange it 's other than that i i 'm 'm not not sure i could max as as a a character and if if you you want more of of max you will will have have a a great that are are great that are make it hard to good and and just for what could have have been,positive
i 've only played the first episodes during the advanced access but i am absolutely loving it so far yes it 's different than what most people wanted but that does n't mean it 's bad i for one am enjoying it i 've 've only only played played the the first first episodes during the advanced access but i i am so far it 's but that does n't it 's for one enjoying it,positive
this game on max 's trauma from the original as i would have it definitely has a to it than the of true colours it does also on true colours a lot too only chapter is right now so i 'll update this review once the full game is out and i 've finished it but in the here are my thoughts so far the story is good and definitely the best plot we 've seen since the original without getting into spoilers you 'll be max 's trauma and of course a new mystery unlike true colours this mystery actually feels important and it 's looking like it 's going to have quite a lot of as we go through too it does start pretty with chapter it takes it 's time characters and showing off the which is n't a bad thing and then things start to up in chapter overall i 'm hooked and very excited to see where this story the choices are also better here i think one of my major about true colours was the lack of real choices nothing you did mattered and the game was pretty here i have already made several choices that have come back to me in the with certain characters as usual i this will have an affect on the overall plot but it definitely does affect relationships with characters which is great a certain character is currently very with me and no longer me i 'm curious to see how this out the music so far is great the music is a bit of a weird choice but everything else very well i especially like the music when you 're around in a certain timeline it 's a visually of course this game looks fantastic too again great use of colours between the timelines and the animations here are top it 's definitely deck nine 's strong the characters look great and their facial expressions say a lot now let 's talk about some of the issues first of all performance is a bit off i can get it at fps with everything out for shadows medium and medium honestly though i have n't a change in when these settings it 's not a huge issue since it runs well and looks good with those settings turned down but still i do n't think it 's the of game that should need that much power but there 's also no which is pretty the other issue is bugs there 's nothing game here or anything too serious i 've only encountered one in my hours that 's happened on two and that 's with for some reason door 's will just in the air it 's weird but it does n't break anything this only ever with an door and again it 's only happened to me it 's a minor issue but it 's pretty big to me bring back i do n't mean waiting between each episode but the way chapters work currently is `` '' start chapter into the game get to a chapter end here are your choices '' '' i really miss the old feel where you 'd get a of where each character was at the end of the episode and where the story is currently going over a then the next episode would start with a and then you 'd be back into it it 's a small thing but i always thought that was really cool and i really hope d bring that back in the future i miss it overall i think this is looking promising an interesting narrative with interesting choices in an interesting setting pretty much what i wanted from this game this game on max max 's from the the original as i i would would have it definitely has a than the true colours it does true colours a lot right now so i i 'll the full full game game is is out out and and i i 've it but but in in the here are so far far the the story story is is good good and the best since the the original you 'll max 's and of of course a new true colours and it it 's like it it 's going to to have quite a a lot lot of as we it does it 's characters and which is is n't and then overall i i 'm hooked and and very excited to to see see where this story the choices choices are here i i think one of of my true colours was the lack of you did and the the game game was here i i have choices that back to in the with certain as usual will have on the the overall but it it definitely which is a certain i 'm to see the music so far great the is a a bit of a very well well i like the when you you 're in a a certain it 's 's a of course this game use of between the and the here are it 's deck nine the characters great and facial expressions a lot let 's some of of the is a a bit off i i can can get get it though i i have it 's 's not not a a huge it runs but still i do do n't think it it 's game that that much there 's which is is pretty the other issue is there 's i 've 've only in my that 's and that that 's for some in the it 's but it it does does n't it 's 's only happened to to me it 's 's a but it it 's to me i do do n't but the the way `` '' into the the game get to to a here are your choices '' '' i really miss the the old where you each character at the the end end of of the where the the story story is the next with a and then then you it 's 's a thing but but i that was was really and i i really in the the future overall i i think think this this is an interesting narrative with an interesting pretty much what i i wanted this game,positive
played the first episodes a few times now absolutely a to play love the graphics and the story is quite interesting so far ca n't wait for the last episodes played the the first first episodes a few to play love the the graphics graphics and and the the story story is is quite so far ca n't n't wait wait for for the the last,positive

issue with this game was the story i 'm really not sure how they to ♥♥♥♥ up such a great set up a murder mystery multiple timelines has so much potential but the plot its focus and into in one moment the ending was a complete disaster and the entire last chapter of just makes the rest of the story and everything set up before questions are not they are max is still amazing and the game together although the writing for her inner thoughts is at times this is extra in the scene at the safi is a disaster that feels like she was written by two different people who were not to talk to each other amanda is completely the cast and setting is also generally small unlike previous entries the game is set in a single university with only about characters your choices do not matter in this game almost every big decision has no to the story beyond some different dialogue in one scene before everyone what you did also it runs like ♥♥♥♥ i wish developers would stop using with this this game game was was the the story story i i 'm not sure how they such a a great set up up a murder mystery so much the plot in one the ending ending was was a and the the entire the rest rest of of the the story story and set up are not they are max is is still amazing and the game the writing for her her inner at times this is in the at the safi is is a feels like she was talk to to each the game game is in a with only your choices do not in this this game to the the story in one what you you did it runs i wish,positive

`` this will have consequences '' as a long time fan of the franchise i think the developers some with a new power system that feels both and of the abilities seen in 's i also think the option to your own photos for or journal entries a while the soundtrack as perfectly the story 's more murder mystery if you 've played previous titles its to see max as an although i there were more interactions with characters in the franchise the rest of the new cast are all with and they feel fully out however while the setup and writing are decent the of the time between the and previous feels disappointing based on the first game 's major ending which seems to better in the story though it doesn ’ t excuse a of i 'm excited to see what ’ s next on the full release coming but it ’ s hard not to think of what might have been if they had the time between the titles more will have as a fan of of the the franchise i think think the the developers with a a new new power of the i also also think think the the option while the the soundtrack the story murder mystery if you you 've 've played to see as an there were were more characters in in the the franchise the rest rest of of the the new new cast and they while the of the the time between the based on on the the first first game seems to in the the story though it doesn ’ ’ t i 'm excited to to see see what ’ s on the the full full release but it it ’ ’ s of what might have have been if they they had the time between the,positive

's shaka seeing hannah telle being back as max caulfield was a of fresh air to the series as it 's been almost a decade since her character was back on the main the story itself i could say was at best to the previous of the series if it would n't have had max i would say the story would be at best personally true colours to me was more enjoyable and to play than this my own opinion tho one of my main regarding the game is the choices for between two of the side characters having to choose in the beginning of the game was not my cup of in the the plot regarding alderman did not with my very well as it seemed to have been through out the episodes and then to be and about as if nothing happened i would give double exposure a i do n't recommend as i have as the seem to heavily the i am interested on where the series as it that max will be returning for another and hopefully we get more information regarding chloe hannah telle as max max caulfield was a to the the series series as as it it 's on the the main the story i could at best to the the previous of the the series if it it would would n't n't have i would would say the story would be at best true colours to me to play my own one of of my the game game is is the between two of the to choose in the the beginning beginning of of the the game game was was not cup of in the the plot did not with my very well well as as it seemed to to have have been episodes and and then as if i would double exposure a i i do do n't as i i have as the seem to i am where the the series as it that max max will,positive

i absolutely lis and while i understand many of the that people have about this sequel i genuinely think this was a fantastic addition to the series as expected with the in the facial expressions and character are better than previous titles some parts of the story me a little and i did n't quite understand how the resolution came to be trying to avoid spoilers but overall i ended the game feeling content with the hours i spent with max it felt and just like the first game i had a playing however the decisions do not feel as as they did in the first game in lis you have two different outcomes you can end up with but in this installment it seems no matter what choice you make it you to the same this is n't a bad thing since your choices can change other characters of you and how those interactions take place throughout the story but i do wish there were more endings to explore this game is definitely setting up for another sequel which i will with but i just hope that a lot of the decisions we made in this game can carry over to that and continue with max the romance for example as for the in the i had the bay ending in the first game so i felt that my playthrough made perfect sense and with what i expected to after the ending of lis with that said i do n't feel that i can make a proper on how they handled the bae ending until i go through and replay the story with that choice my final for this game falls on the romance this has always been a very fun side objective in all the lis games and it 's no different here however i the fact that you through an entire scene have the option to romance someone and then there are no more interactions you can throughout the first few episodes with one of two characters but it 's only in episode where you can actually make a or not beyond that there really are n't any more to out or talk with that person i know this is n't the point of the game but if you 're gon na make it an option i think there should be multiple where you can and explore that as an side objective as i before i 'm hoping that with the sequel that 's to be we can actually carry over all the choices that were made and these relationships final thoughts the story was unexpected and i found myself enjoying it and following it pretty easily besides some minor and by the characters towards the end i really loved seeing max again in all her her inner was always one of my favorite parts of lis and i felt that they kept that same in this sequel she felt like the same max slightly different facial design and the dialogue throughout the game came off as realistic and not forced her new power was fun to use and i enjoyed the little side you could do like other characters etc the end chapter as always is a fun way to see what other players are doing in their and i enjoyed my choices with i am for the future of lis and i believe deck nine did a great job overall with this sequel i ca n't wait to see what max will do next lis and and while while i of the about this this sequel sequel i think this this was was a a fantastic to the the series series as with the the facial facial expressions better than parts of of the the story and i i did did n't how the to be trying to overall i the game with the hours i with max it felt and just like the the first first game game i i had had a however the the decisions do not as they they did in the the first first game game in in lis you have different outcomes you can up with but in in this it seems make it you to to the the same this is is n't your choices other characters throughout the the story story but but i i do there were were more to explore this game game is setting up which i i will but i i just a lot lot of of the the decisions in this this game to that that and with max the romance for example for the in the i had bay ending in the the first first game game so so i i felt felt that what i after the the ending of lis with that said i i do do n't n't feel that i i can make a a proper how they they handled handled the the bae bae ending through and replay the the story with that for this this game on the the romance has always always been been a a very in all all the the lis lis games games and and it it 's the fact fact that that you an entire have the the option and then there are you can throughout the the first one of but it it 's 's only where you you can make a or not that there are n't with that i know this is is n't n't the the point of the the game game but but if if you you 're gon na make it i think should be where you you can as an as i i 'm with the the sequel that 's to be all the the choices choices that the story story was and i i found found myself enjoying it it and by the the characters the end end i i really max again in all her inner one of of my my favorite parts of of lis lis and and i i felt felt that that they in this this sequel felt like like the the same and the the dialogue throughout the the game off as realistic and new power and i i enjoyed you could other characters the end is a way to to see see what and i i enjoyed i am for the the future of lis lis and and i deck nine did a a great with this this sequel sequel i i ca ca n't n't wait wait to to see see what max will,positive

absolutely fantastic game so far really to see where the story is going after the events of the first two episodes have played through and loved the other lis games and am loving this one so far as well my choice from the first game was bae and i felt like they have handled that ending well so far in double exposure especially considering the of trauma that comes with making that of choice people seem to think it 's all and after of people let what that does for the person you save they 've handled it will so far considering the two of them were in high when all of those events to each their own though there are some minor bugs that i 've encountered so far and hope that they end up those out by the time the full game releases this hopefully there are n't any major bugs with the full outside of that the characters are great the dialogue is fun and there is more mystery to this game than previous here 's to hoping that they are able to pull off the ending with what has been set up so far my review could very well change if it falls but if you like choice games and have enjoyed all of the life is strange games then you 're in for quite a after it i still love the game but for different reasons from other lis games is n't my favorite in the series but is still a very good game also the soundtrack is beautiful and incredible like other lis games game so so far to see see where where the the story story is is going after the of the the first first two two episodes through and loved the the other other lis lis games games and this one so far as well from the the first first game game was and i i felt felt like like they they have so far in double double exposure considering the seem to think it it 's of people for the it will so far considering the the two of them all of to each there are are some minor bugs that i i 've so far that they by the the time the full full game there are are n't with the the full of that that the the characters characters are are great great the the dialogue fun and and there there is this game that they they are able to the ending has been set up so far my review very well if it but if if you games and and have all of of the the life life is is strange strange games then you you 're quite a it i i still love the the game game but but for other lis lis games is n't my favorite in the the series series but is still still a a very very good good game the soundtrack other lis lis games,positive
people so about the whole chloe thing but since there were endings to the first game it would make no sense to have a completely different story line in the game with chloe present and one story line without her personally chose to her in my play through since i could n't of people for one person also we only have access to the first chapters and in the first chapter there was several to the whole arcadia thing her death for me since i chose that option in this game but you would hope if you chose the option that they grew up that there might be an at some point in later chapters but i 've been enjoying it so far and find it slightly people are for the reason that chloe is n't in the story but it would n't work considering the different endings in the game about the the whole thing but there were to the the first first game game it it would to have have a in the the game with chloe chose to her in in my i could could n't of people for one only have have access access to to the the first first chapters chapters and and in in the the first there was to the the whole her death for me in this this game game but if you you chose chose the the option that they that there point in but i i 've 've been enjoying it so far people are for the is n't in the the story story but but it it would would n't considering the endings in in the,positive
what a game so far the first episodes are incredible these games are just something you can tell the put alot of love into them i love the series lis but if you love these games then buy it as you will not regret it end game update really great game but wish it was a bit longer i do miss the old character tho like etc but for me this is a solid also true colors still remains my in the series a game game so so far far the the first first episodes these games are just you can i love love the the series but if if you these games buy it you will game but it was was a a bit i do miss the the old but for for me this is is a true colors in the the series,positive

i was surprised at how engaging and the story was after reading all the reviews i think this game is to the first and the series but the lower reviews are due to a new of this game is a lot of fun and max is still max just older and i really liked this game i was the story story was all the i think think this this game game is to the the first and the the series series but but the due to to a a new this game game is is a a lot lot of fun and and max max is is still i really this game,positive
the game is good so far not great but it 's good i do n't really think that the ultimate or edition is worth the price i 'd say that if you really want to play it just save yourself the money and buy the version i only really the ultimate edition to avoid spoilers and such the graphics in the game are good i still the original graphics but the graphics in this game are still good and the so far but i do n't with how they said they would the two endings i did n't feel like the arcadia bay ending was at all at least if you had to chloe like i did i have mixed feelings about this game for sure because while i do feel like its a i still enjoyed the game so far other than the other reasons and some here and there as to be expected with games if you want to enjoy the game but do n't feel like money save yourself the and watch a playthrough but if you want to play it yourself like i did that too i do n't regret buying the ultimate edition and playing it for myself but i do overall feel like it 's not the best decision the game game is is good so far but it it 's good i i do do n't n't really that the the ultimate worth the the price i 'd say that if you you really want to to play it just i only the ultimate ultimate edition the graphics in the the game good i i still the original but the the graphics in this this game good and and the so far but i i do do n't with how how they they would the two two endings i did did n't n't feel feel like like the arcadia bay bay ending ending was at all at least if you like i i did i have mixed feelings feelings about about this this game game for while i i do feel like i still still enjoyed enjoyed the the game game so so far other than than the the other and some and there to be if you you want want to enjoy the the game game but do n't n't feel feel like but if if you you want want to to play like i i did i do do n't the ultimate ultimate edition but i i do feel like like it it 's 's not the best,positive
plot is strange double exposure the game is visually great the characters are perfectly and i was able to the 's for and their fine writing of each character more max who remains to the one we know from the previous games on the other hand the story left something to be with certain narrative elements very even which is to the first life is strange games the story seemed than the others there was a lack of impact on the possible choices and the consequences were almost i still recommend because it felt like a good experience but it was not worth € or even more with the two extra dlcs is strange strange double double exposure the game game is great the the characters characters are and i i was able to each character to the the one from the the previous previous games on the the other the story to be with certain which is to the the first first life life is is strange strange games the story than the there was was a lack of impact on on the choices and and the i still because it it felt felt like like a a good but it it was was not even more with the the two,positive
